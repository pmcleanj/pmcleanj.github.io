<h1>Learning Gaelic on Your Own: Student Notes</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>I was asked: “Does anyone know how the Eurotalk App works? I am a complete beginner and 
	these language learning programs, always help me the best.”</p>
	<p>I've used it. It isn't even vaguely "immersion", though it may help you learn a few 
	short vocabulary lists. That's a start, but it won't get you to conversational. And Gaelic 
	culture is essentially communal: conversation, song and story -- that is the goal. The same
	can be said about the Atlantic Gaelic Academy's Skype classes, or "beag air beag", or the 
	Mango Languages programme, or RadioLingua's charming "One Minute Gaelic" podcast. They can 
	get you started, but they are unlikely to bring you to fluency. To acquire fluency, you 
	need immersion.</p>
	<p>Immersion is about USING Gaelic in the everyday things you do, and having the sounds of 
	it going on all around you. And it works. There are a lot of vernacular Gaelic recordings 
	on the web. Make a play-list of it and put it on a continuous loop on your devices. Play it 
	on the radio while you're doing household chores. Watch Gaelic TV -- Machair is available 
	on youtube, and Bannon can often be found on streaming services. Listen to lesson tapes 
	(Speaking Our Language is good, or Can Seo -- both on Youtube -- or the CDs from Complete 
	Gaelic (which you can buy as a Kindle book) or Catriona NicIobhair's "Gaelic through 
	Conversation"
	(<A HREF="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gaeliccollege.edu%2Fonlineshop%2Fproduct%2Fgaelic-through-conversation-individual%2F&amp;h=ATM-hNA38a7KmGisfEa1WWjNSHD3hH26pX7vXLRKaVBJVhee0B-hq7OaladDjEiNAJO1MMXnYTNmhM1uz4RPFxpmwnW37BkIe2euJbY6FDXqUM9WmcYWMtpO1KPQCbDGeIK0e_ksEg" TARGET="_blank">http://www.gaeliccollege.edu/.../gaelic-through.../</A>)
	while you are driving or walking. Set your operating system language to Gaelic on your 
	i-Devices or Mac (or lobby Windows and Google to provide Gaelic for your non-Apple devices). 
	Install the Firefox browser and Open Office in Gaelic. It will slow you down, but you're
	probably familiar enough with computers to learn quickly that "Faidhle" means "File" and 
	"Deasaich" means "Edit". Seeing "DiMàirt, 17 dhen Fhaoilleach"every time you open your 
	phone will teach you quickly the names of the weekdays and months.</p>

	<p>All that being said, teachers and other learners can waste a very great deal of time
	trying to convince one another that "X" is the <strong>only</strong> way to learn, or that 
	they are <strong>only</strong> capable of learning by method "X". If something helps you 
	learn, then use it. If someone you trust advocates a method, then try it. If you have the
	time, use as many methods as actually work for you. Frankly, if you sincerely believe that
	you "must" study grammar in order to learn, no-one is going to convince you differently 
	and you might as well get on with it and stop wasting time arguing. With increasing 
	experience, most learners see that translation-based techniques should be avoided 
	(see <a href="#Learning">the sidebar about language-learning and the brain</a>) and 
	unceasing aural repetition should be emphasised. And those are the identifying features of 
	immersive learning. Other language-learning tools can give you the bare minimum you need 
	to get started. In some cases they can supplement immersive learning. But immersion is key 
	and without it your learning curve is cut short -- and unless you live in Cape Breton or 
	the Hebrides, immersion is something you have to <strong>do</strong> to <strong>yourself.</strong></p>

	<p>As of Summer 2017, <span class="cite">Learning
	Gaelic On Your Own Course & Guidelines </span>is the latest handbook from the 
	<a href="#https://moraylanguagecentre.weebly.com/">Moray Language Centre</a>,
	a think-tank dedicated to producing targetted Gaelic courses that allow the complete 
	beginner to break through to speaking Gaelic in 200 hours or less. You can obtain your 
	copy of the handbook for $25.
	After you have paid, the handbook will be emailed to you in PDF format from the Moray 
	Language Centre. This web-page is not a substitue for the  Moray Language Centre's 
	<span class="cite">Learning Gaelic On Your Own Course & Guidelines.</span>

	<p>Moray Language Centre courses use a proven effective method referred to as
	“<a href="#http://www.halifaxgaelic.ca/how-it-works">Total Immersion Plus</a>”
	(or “TIP”) developed by the Centre's CEO, Finlay M. Macleod. With the TIP method, students 
	hear and speak only Gaelic during classes:
	whole sentences at a natural spoken tempo, no vocabulary lists, no
	reading or writing, and no grammer lessons. Now TIP may be fine for
	those in Cape Breton or the Hebrides where they can find classrooms
	with fluent presentors! But what about the rest of us, who are
	beginning the work of rebuilding diaspora Gaeltachds “on our own”?
	Fortunately, we have Gaelic radio programmes that can be recorded,
	both on BBC Alba and CBC Cape Breton; and a wealth of recorded Gaelic
	in university archives throughout the world. We will immerse
	ourselves in those recordings. How to do that, and succeed, is the
	substance of the <span class="cite"> Learning Gaelic On Your Own Course & Guidelines </span>
	handbook.</p>

	<h2 id="Overview">Course Overview</h2>

	<p>Language acquisition is all about repetition: hearing words and phrases repeated over 
	and over, and then repeating over and over the phrases you have heard. Here's how it works 
	when you are learning Gaelic using radio programmes:</p>


		<h3>Month #1</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose one (and only one) radio programme to study for the month. It must
				be conversational, exclusively in the Gaelic language, with two or more speakers.</li>
			<li>Download or record the programme. Edit out any English.</li>
			<li>Days 1-5: Listen to the programme as often as possible. Aim for at least three 
				times a day. Don't worry about not understanding it.</li>
			<li>Days 6-15: Listen to the programme, and try to say the words simultaneously with 
				the presentors.</li>
			<li>Days 16-30: Record yourself repeating the words of the programme, in 3 to 7-second 
				chunks. Listen to your recording and compare it to the original.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Month #2:</h3>
		Repeat, with a new recording
		<h3>Month #3</h3>
		Repeat, with a new recording
		<h3>Month #4</h3>
		Review the sound files from the last three months</p>
		<h3>Months #5 through #8</h3>
		Repeat the four-month cycle.
		<h3>Months #9 through #12</h3>
		Repeat the four-month cycle.
		<h3>Months #13 through #36</h3>
		<p>After a year, take a couple of months to review what you did in the previous year.</p>
		<p>After eighteen months, start having regular conversations with Gaelic speakers in 
			addition to this work</p>
		<p>After two years, do another annual review.</p>
		<p>After three years, look into other <a href="#https://moraylanguagecentre.weebly.com/">Moray
			Language Centre</a> programmes to enrich your Gaelic, for example, by shifting the
		    language of family and home from English to Gaelic.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT></FONT></SPAN></p>

	<h2 id="Equipment">Equipment</h2>

	<ol>
	
	<li>A laptop computer for accessing the radio programmes, with internet access.</li>
	<p>The most up-to-date readily available programmes are from <a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/radionangaidheal">
	BBC Alba</a>. They are available 24 hours a day, for 19 days after they originally air. The 
	three programmes recommended by MLC are<a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jddy">
	Aithris Na Maidne</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jdft">Aithris Na 
	Fisgear</a>, and <a href="#https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007tz90">Coinneach Mòr</a>.</p>
	<p>If you are particularly computer-literate, feel free to use any device that allows you 
	to record and edit streaming audio. If you have a horror of computers, feel free to use a 
	dictophone or tape recorder. In either case, skip the next four paragraphs and do things 
	your own way.</p>
	
	<li>Audacity</li>
	<p>Audacity is free computer software, which you can download at
	<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">https://www.audacityteam.org</a>.
	You'll use it to record streamed Gaelic programmes, edit out any
	English, to record your own voice repeating Gaelic words and phrases,
	and to save the programme as an MP3 that you can listen to on your
	phone or MP3 player as you go about your daily life.</p>
	
	<li>“looping” or feedback hardware or software*</li>
	<p>For a Mac, you'll want<a href="#https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower/releases/download/2.0b2/Soundflower-2.0b2.dmg">Soundflower</a>.
	This is also free computer software, which you can download by clicking that link. It 
	reroutes your computer's soundcard to Audacity's input. For Windows or Linux this 
	feature is built in.</p>
	
	<li>A smartphone (or other touch device) with a music player, earbuds, and a voice-memo app.</li>
    <p>A smart-phone's touch screen has no moving parts. It's designed for you to interact 
	with the screen frequently and for a long time without wearing out, and is designed for 
	that level of use. When you get to the third week and begin recording your own voice, 
	you will probably want two devices: one for recording and one for playback. Although 
	language-acquisition apps exist that allow you to listen to a clip and then record it, 
	I haven't yet found one that lets you load your own source audio into the app. </p>
	
	<li>Storage</li>
	<p>A 90-minute MP3 recording of a Gaelic radio programme is about 100MB. Over three 
	years you'll record 24 of these programmes, and then record your own voice copying the 
	programmes, so you'll need about 4.8 GB of storage. You can store that on your hard-
	drive, on an 8GB USB key, or on the “cloud”. Just remember to make backups.</p>
	</ol>
	
<div class="leftSidebar">
	<h3 id="Sound">*A Bit about Sound on the Internet</h3>
	
	<p>If you use a music service like iTunes or or Google play, you'll be used to the 
	idea of “downloading music”. The song is a digital file stored on the Internet. 
	Downloading it makes a copy on your device. You then play the copy as often as you 
	like. Downloading takes only a few seconds, even though the song may be minutes 
	long.</p>

	<p>Some Gaelic archives let you download their content in the same way. The files 
	will be called something like .mp3 or .mp4 or .wav. Some content providers – like 
	the BBC – don't want to let you have a copy of the programme, because of copyright.
	So they don't let you do a simple download of the sound file. They give you a link 
	that sends the sound-file only to your computer's sound card at the same speed that 
	it plays at. They want you to think you can't “download” the file. But, in order for 
	your computer to play the programme, your computer HAS to have access to it. It IS 
	loaded “down” to your computer from the Internet – just slowly and without being 
	stored as a file on the way. Such providers are counting on your sound card to play 
	the data and discard it immediately.</p>

	<p>Since the data DOES come through your computer, you DO have access to it. You just need 
	a way for your sound card, instead of discarding the data as it is played, to send the 
	data to something that will store it. A looping device takes the data from your sound card 
	and sends it to another app: in this case, to Audacity.</p>

<h4>Recording the first Programme</h4>

<p>Open Audacity on your computer.</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse.png">
<p>In the top left corner are the control buttons for recording and
playback – Pause, Play, Stop, to Start, to End, Record:</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse1.png">
<p>Just under these control buttons, there are four fields with drop-down lists used to 
set up the input (what will be recorded) and the output (what will be played).</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse2.png">
<p>If you are using a Mac, leave the first field at “Core Audio” and set the second field 
to “Soundflower (2ch)”. If you are using Windows, set the first field to “Windows WASAPI” 
and set the second field to “Speakers (loopback)*”.</p>
<p>*There may be other options in the dropdown box. For Windows systems, always pick 
something that shows “loopback” for the second window.</p>
<p>Set the third field to “1 (Mono)”.</p>
<p>Set the fourth field to “Built-In Output” (or “Speakers” if you are using external 
speakers)*.</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse3.png">
<p>Click the “Record” button. A window will open and begin drawing a long straight blue 
line. It is recording, but there is no sound on the input:</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse4.png">
</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jddy">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jddy</a>.
Begin playing the episode you want to record, and adjust your volume
so that it is loud and clear. Then stop the episode. Click on your
system speaker icon, and select “Soundflower (2ch)” -- if you are
using a Mac – or “Speakers (loopback)” -- if you are using
Windows.</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse5.png">
<p>Now,
start the episode playing again. Return to Audacity: you will see
that the blue trace now shows oscillations representing the sound
that is being recorded. </FONT>
</p>
			<img class="screenshot" src="AudacityUse6.png">
<p>Leave the programme playing aloud for the full 90 minutes. If you silence it or turn off your sound, it will stop recording. If you receive any
other sounds on your computer, such as beeps or notifications, they
will be captured on your recording. </FONT>
</p>
<p>When the programme is complete, go back to the beginning and delete all of
the silence – that is, the flat line -- at the beginning of the
recording. Then go to <span class="cite">File ... Save Project As </span>... and
save it under name with a .aup file extension: for example
AithrisNaMaidne20180620.aup. </p>

<h4>Breaking the Project into Tracks</h4>

<p>Aithris Na Maidne is a ninety-minute news review
programme covering a range of topics with different presenters and
different styles. You may want to break it into a series of shorter
“tracks”. Shorter tracks have a number of advantages over a
single 90-minute track. Each episode of Aithris Na Maidne follows the
same standard pattern, and you can define the tracks based on that
pattern. The precise times vary slightly, the following being the
track breakdown from June 20 2018:</p>

<p>Go
through the programme: select about 5 minutes of audio, and copy it
into a new Audacity project. Choose <span class="cite">File ... Export ... Export
as MP3</span>
and save it with a slightly different name and the .mp3 file
extension: for example AithrisNaMaidne20180620-1.mp3. When prompted
for additional information, make sure you enter exactly the same
“Album” name for each track, and make sure you enter the correct
“track number”. This will allow you to play all the clips in
order when you begin listening via your smartphone or music player.</p>
<p>Continue exporting 5-minute “tracks”
in MP3 format until the whole programme is exported. Excise any
English segments you notice while doing this. 18 5-minute tracks are
easier to manage in your device than one 90-minute track.</p>
<h4 STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal">Sync
the Tracks onto Your Phone or MP3 Player</h4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none">
Finally, import the mp3 files into
your music player or smartphone. To import them into iTunes:</p>
<UL>
	<li><p>Open iTunes</p>
	<li><p>Choose File ... Add to Library</p>
	<li><p>Select the MP3 tracks you have created</p>
	<li><p>click “Open”</p>
</UL>
<p>Your Gaelic tracks will be moved to your iTunes library and you can sync them to your 
device in the same way as any other music.</p>

Play the album over and over, many times a day if possible. Use
earbuds to shut out other sounds that might interfere with the Gaelic
pathways you are building. Listen while you walk, or do housework, or
work out. Do not worry about understanding: just let the Gaelic soak
in. If you know any words of Gaelic, listen to see if they pop out at
you: some common words to listen for are “agus”, “ag radh”,.
If if doesn't disturb your sleep, leave the album playing quietly all
night (Sleep and learning researchers are divided about whether this
helps, but feel free to try it.</p>

<h3>*A Bit About Learning and the Brain.</h3>
			<img src="languageLearning.png">
	ordinary language course starts with going through the alphabet and
	associating Gaelic phonemes with the letters, even using English
	phonics to spell equivalent phonemes, and then with memorizing a
	list of vocabulary and grammer rules. That kind of learning means
	that when you speak, you go through a process like that shown above.</p>
	<p>When you are learning
	something, your brain is creating neural pathways for your thoughts
	to flow along; much the way water creates a channel or pathway when
	ice melts and begins to flow downhill. The more your thoughts follow
	that pathway, the stronger that pathway will be – like water
	digging a deeper and deeper channel. If you learn by translation and
	grammer, your Gaelic will become “entrenched” in this kind of
	thought-pathway.</p>

	<p>An ordinary course teaches a lot about Gaelic and a lot about
	linguistics. It doesn't create fluency. Fluency looks like this:
				<img width=50% src="languageLearning2.png">
	A connection must exist directly from the
	abstract idea or visualization of apple, to the word “Ubhal”
	complete with its pronunciation. Children who grew up around
	Gaelic-speaking grandparents have a head-start, even if they never
	learned Gaelic, because their brain has already built pathways for
	distinguishing the sounds of Gaelic, just by hearing it. The first
	five days you spend “Gaelic-washing” your brain, are building
	the neural pathways for processing Gaelic sounds. </p>
	<p>Although this course
	doesn't use vocabulary flip cards, any courses that do use flipcards
	should use a similar “no-translation” technique: a picture on
	one side, and the word in the target language on the other side;
	nothing at all on the card should be in the majority language.</p>

<h4>Days 6 to 15: Listening intently for word patterns</h4>

<p>After five days, the programme script should feel
familiar. You should be automatically sensing what sounds will come
next. Concentrate and try to repeat the script simultaneously with
the programme presenters.  Set regular times to work on active
listening. Choose  a regular environment to work in, free of English
sounds and English writing and other distractions. Try to listen to
the script at least three times a day with this level of
concentration. Three times a day is four and a half hours. If you can
manage that, then these ten days will add up to 45 hours! If you
can't manage it, then remember twice through is still better than
one, and once through is better than none.</p>

<h4>Days 16 to 30: Repeating the Sounds of the Language</h4>

<p>After fifteen days, you should be becoming
comfortable subvocalizing the script simultaneously with the
presenters. Now you will work on making those sounds for yourself.
You'll need to record your own voice as well as listening to the
presenters' voices. There are two good options for doing this:</p>
<H4>Music Player and Voice Memos:</H4>
<UL>
	<li><p>Play 3 to 7 seconds of the programme on your
	smartphone's music app, and hit “Pause”.</p>
	<li><p>Switch to the voice memo app and hit
	“Record”. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Repeat aloud the 3 to 7 seconds you just
	heard, while recording yourself; then hit “Pause”.</p>
	<li><p>Return to the music app, and repeat</p>
	<li><p>Continue for an hour to an hour and a half,
	by which time you should have recorded about ten minutes of content.</p>
</UL>
<p>This option has the advantage that, even though
you need to use your hands, it is portable: you can do it while out
walking or while working on the treadmill. The disadvantage is that
switching back and forth between apps can be quite cumbersome. You
may find you forget the phrase while you are managing the apps.</p>

<H4>Music Player and Voice Memos on two different devices:</H4>
<UL>
	<li><p>Play 3 to 7 seconds of the programme on your
	smartphone's music app, and hit “Pause” on device #1.</p>
	<li><p>Hit “Record” on the voice memo app of device #2. </p>
	</p>
	<li><p>Repeat aloud the 3 to 7 seconds you just
	heard, while recording yourself; then hit “Pause”.</p>
	<li><p>Return to the music app on device #1, and repeat</p>
	<li><p>Continue for an hour to an hour and a half,
	by which time you should have recorded about ten minutes of content.</p>
</UL>
<p>This option has the advantage that you don't lose time and focus switching between apps,
and it is still portable. The disadvantage is that you have to be lucky enough to afford
two smart devices.</p>

<H4>Audacity:</H4>
<UL>
	<li><p>Open Audacity and load in the original .aup
	file that you created on day zero. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Press “play”, then “pause”, to play 3
	to 7 seconds of the programme.</p>
	<li><p>Press “mute” on the original track, then
	press “record” and repeat the 3 to 7 seconds you have just
	heard, recording yourself. Audacity will open a second track to
	contain any new recording. Press “pause”.</p>
	<li><p>Press “solo” on the original track, and
	repeat.</p>
</UL>
<UL>
	<li><p>Continue for an hour to an hour and a half,
	by which time you should have recorded about ten minutes of content.</p>
</UL>
<p>This option has the advantage that listen and
record can be done with a single app, without switching back and
forth. However since it requires a laptop, you are generally
restricted to your desk while doing this work.</p>
<p>I continue to search for an integrated listen-and-record smartphone app that allows you 
to load in your own sound files.</p>
<p>Be aware that the muscles of your face and throat will tire easily at first, because 
they are being used in new ways. They will strengthen as you continue the work.</p>
