Hissed with ill-controlled anger and heavy with vague threat, the words are calculated to fill a parent's heart with panic. Fight or flight are the instinctive reactions, but a parent is wise to do neither. The wrong understanding betrayed by those words is best allowed to wither away in silence.</font>&nbsp;</font> &nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The ideal of controlling devolves from an era when children were seen as the property of their parents, to be constrained to their parents will and used for their parents' profit. As Christians, our role is not the control, but the education of children:</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<ul><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control wins social approval for the parent, but education gives resources to the child.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control gratifies with instant results, but education is gradual and demanding of patience.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control entrenches parental dominance because it must be constantly maintained; but education gives children self-control so that they can mature beyond the need for our teaching.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control aims to limit our childrens' behaviour; Education aims to broaden their understanding.</font></font></ul><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">In short, control benefits adults; education benefits children.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Does this mean that children will be rowdy and uncontrolled? Of course not! As children grow in independence and physical ability, their understanding also grows. Parents can capture every opportunity to teach the <b><i>underlying principals </i></b>of Christian deportment, at a level appropriate to a child's understanding. For example, even very young children can understand:</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<ul><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">You must love God; you may not annoy other people; you must take care of yourself <b><i>(the Great Commandment)</i></b></font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">If you don't like it when someone does it to you, probably they don't like it when you do it to them <b><i>(the golden rule)</i></b></font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Stronger people take care of weaker people, big people take care of little people <b><i>(the rule of Chivalry)</i></b></font></font></ul><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Gradually parents teach their children to discern behaviours that reflect underlying principals. A thoughtful heart driving thoughtful behaviour is more reliable than stern control overriding a rebellious heart! From time to time children push the limits of acceptable behaviour, signalling that it is time for the parents to refine further on the child's understanding. Sometimes the child's response to such limitsetting is loud, sometimes gracious; but the parent's role in limit-setting need not be obtrusive. If others don't notice a parent setting limits, it may be their awareness, not the parent's discipline, that's falling short. All that matters is that the child notices!</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">There is one other overriding reason that we cannot treat our children as possessions under our control. With infant baptism, our children become children of God: the precise status that we enjoy ourselves! God has no grandchildren. In baptism our children become our <i>brothers and sisters</i> in Christ. It would be grossly inappropriate to domineer or usurp authority over them. Rather, as Ananias taught Paul, as Prisca and Acquilla instructed Appollos, as adults encourage one-another to grow to Christian maturity, such are our duties to these little brethren.</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Why though, must we inflict our children on the rest of the community during the slow, challenging period of their education? Precisely because it <b><i>is</i></b> a community. None of us are yet perfected before God. But even imperfect, we are accepted by the One Who matters most. The nature of community is to accept: to nurture, to encourage, and to upbuild one another.</font></font></ul></table></center> <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font> <br> <b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></b> <center><font size="-1">Back to <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html">Denizens of the Logrus</a></font></center><div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/StLydiaMass/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;Next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Stlydiamass</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/Parenting-apple/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;Previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Parenting Apple</span> </a></div></div></article><small> </small></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
