This could be done with a black-painted paper sheet with holes cut in it , with a light behind it that could be turned off for the other vignettes. Several vignettes rely on a fire. This should be made with small logs stacked "log-cabin" style. Fire-retardent crepe paper flames should be attached on the inside in different lenghths that can be tucked inside the logs and unfolded at need, so that the fire can be made to "flare up": short red flames; medium orange flames; very large yellow flames. A sheilded work-lamp placed in the middle of the stack of logs makes the fire glow.</font></font> <br> &nbsp;<p><font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Prelude and interludes:</b> Two garbage cans, representing an alley <i><b>Properties:</b> Matchbox, small flashlight,</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 1</b>: A small fire centre stage,&nbsp; under an open sky <i><b>Properties</b>: Spears for tribesmen</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 2:</b> A lamp on a lampstand centre stage. A cardboard cutout statue of Zeus that can be toppled over. A small table covered with a table-cloth, on which is set a menorah with candles, stage right. <i><b>Properties:</b> Broken oil flask. Intact flask. Sign reading "Next Day". Sign reading "Seven Days Later"</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 3:</b> Stonehenge. This is just a <i>little</i> ambitious, but it is sufficient just to suggest Stonehenge with a pair of standing stones and capstone, painted on a sheet or a length of paper hanging from a banner-stand. The altar-stone can be made from a low table draped in a sheet painted to look like stone. The fire, with flames hidden inside and the light turned off, should be placed on the altar-stone. All the other stones are imaginary. <i><b>Properties:</b> Holly and ivy garlands. Magnifying glass.</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 4:</b> A mediaeval kitchen, with a large central open fireplace in which is a blazing fire. A stand for a spit, and a rack for the wassail bowl, stand before the fire. <i><b>Properties:</b> Wassail bowl, spit laden with apples, basket of eggs, honey pot, spices, wine-jug, mixing bowl for eggs, 2 wooden spoons.</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 5:</b> Iron bedstead and long table with cloth <i><b>Properties:</b>&nbsp;</i> <i>wassail bowl,&nbsp; menorah. Christmas Tree. Casserole dishes. Bedding.</i></font></font> <br> <font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Lighting</b>: The lighting assumes two spots. It is desirable if a red filter can be placed over the centre-stage spot for vignette #1. The second spot is used to bring the focus back to Leah and Bridget, and should be relatively dim since they are supposed to be hiding in an unlit alley. In vignette #2, however, the second spot is also used to draw the focus to the lighting of the menorah which shows the passage of time, after which it will go back to focussing on Bridget and Leah. If lights are not available, Bridget and Leah should point centre stage when the action starts there and maybe say "Look" as though they are seeing a magical vision, to redirect the audience's focus to centre stage. Bridget and Leah should then sit as still as possible during the vignette. At the end of the vignette, the vignette actors can simply leave the stage, and Bridget and Leah begin moving and speaking again.</font></font> <center><h3> Prelude: December 24 2000 CE, an alley</h3></center> <center><i>The stage is dark.
