		is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in
		the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow
		down to them, nor worship them.
		For I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, and
		visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto
		the third and fourth generation of them that hate
		me, and show mercy unto thousands in them that
		love me and keep my commandments.
		People. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline
		our hearts to keep this law.
		Minister. Thou shalt not take the Name of
		the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will
		not hold him guiltless, that taketh his Name in
		vain.
		People. Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline
		our hearts to keep this law.
		Minister. Remember that thou keep holy the
		Sabbath day. Six days shalt thou labour, and do
		all that thou hast to do; but the seventh day is
		the Sabbath of the LORD thy God.
		In it thou shalt do no manner of work, thou,
		and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant,
		and thy maid-servant, thy cattle, and the stranger
		that is within thy gates. For in six days the LORD
		made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
		them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
		LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.

		UT chiefly are we bound to praise thee for
		the glorious Resurrection of thy Son Jesus
		Christ our Lord: for he is the very Paschal Lamb,
		which was offered for us, and hath taken away
		the sin of the world; who by his death hath
		destroyed death, and by his rising to life again
		hath restored to us everlasting life. Therefore

		HROUGH thy most dearly beloved Son
		Jesus Christ our Lord; who after his most
		glorious Resurrection manifestly appeared to all
		his Apostles, and in their sight ascended up into
		heaven to prepare a place for us; that where he is,
		thither we might also ascend, and reign with him
		in glory. Therefore with Angels, etc.
		Upon Whitsunday, and six days after, and at
		Ordinations and Synods.
		HROUGH Jesus Christ our Lord; according
		to whose most true promise, the Holy Spirit
		came down as at this time from heaven, lighting
		upon the disciples to teach them, and to lead them
		into all truth; giving them both the gift of tongues,

		and also boldness with fervent zeal constantly to
		preach the Gospel unto all nations; whereby we
		have been brought out of darkness and error into
		the clear light and true knowledge of thee, and of
		thy Son Jesus Christ. Therefore with Angels, etc.
		Upon Trinity Sunday.
		HOM with thy co-eternal Son and Holy
		Spirit we confess as one God, in Trinity of
		Persons and in Unity of Substance. For that
		which we believe of thy glory, O Father, the same
		we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
		Therefore with Angels, etc.
		Upon All Saints’ Day and other Festivals of Saints.
		HO in the multitude of thy Saints hast
		compassed us about with so great a cloud
		of witnesses, that we, rejoicing in their fellowship,
		may run with patience the race that is
		set before us, and together with them may receive
		the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
		Therefore with Angels, etc.
		After each of which shall be said or sung:
		HEREFORE with Angels and Archangels,
		and with all the company of heaven, we laud
		and magnify thy glorious Name; evermore praising
		thee and saying:
		OLY, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts,
		Heaven and earth are full of thy
		glory. Glory be to thee, O Lord Most
		High.
		Either here, or immediately before the Communion, the Priest
		and people may say or sing:
		LESSED is he that cometh in the Name of
		the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.

		Then shall the Priest proceed with the Prayer of Consecration
		and the Breaking of the Bread before the people.
		LESSING and glory and thanksgiving be
		unto thee Almighty God, our heavenly Father,
		who of thy tender mercy didst give thine only Son
		Jesus Christ to take our nature upon him, and to
		suffer death upon the Cross for our redemption;
		who made there, by his one oblation of himself
		once offered, a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice,
		oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole
		world; and did institute, and in his holy Gospel
		command us to continue, a perpetual memorial of
		that his precious death, until his coming again.
		Hear us, O merciful Father, we most humbly
		beseech thee; and grant that we receiving these
		thy creatures of bread and wine, according to thy
		Son our Saviour Jesus Christ's holy institution,
		in remembrance of his death and passion, may
		be partakers of his most blessed Body and Blood;
		who, in the same night that he was betrayed,
		atook Bread; and, when he had
		given thanks, bhe brake it; and
		gave it to his disciples, saying,
		Take, eat; cthis is my Body
		which is given for you: Do this
		in remembrance of me. Likewise
		after supper dhe took the Cup;
		and, when he had given thanks, he
		gave it to them, saying, Drink ye
		all, of this; for ethis is my Blood
		of the new Covenant, which is
		shed for you and for many for
		the remission of sins: Do this,
		as oft as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me.
		Wherefore, O Father, Lord of heaven and
		earth, we thy humble servants, with all thy holy
		Church, remembering the precious death of thy

				beloved Son, his mighty resurrection, and glorious

		hath commanded; And we entirely desire thy
		fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our
		sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, most humbly
		beseeching thee to grant, that by the merits and
		death of thy Son Jesus Christ, and through faith
		in his blood, we and all thy whole Church may
		obtain remission of our sins, and all other benefits

		E do not presume to come to this thy Table,
		O merciful Lord, Trusting in our own

		mercies. We are not worthy So much as to gather
		up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the

		eat the Flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, And to
		drink his Blood, That our sinful bodies may be
		made clean by his Body, And our souls washed
		through his most precious Blood, And that we
		may evermore dwell in him, And he in us. Amen.
		Then shall the Preist first receive
		THE COMMUNION
		in both kinds himself, and then proceed to deliver the same to the
		Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, in like manner, (if any be present,)
		and after that to the people also in order, into their hands, all

		HE Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
		was given for thee, preserve thy body and
		soul unto everlasting life: Take and eat this in
		remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed
		on him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving.
		And the Minister that delivers the Cup shall likewise say:
		HE Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
		shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto
		everlasting life: Drink this in remembrance that
		Christ’s Blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.
		In the Communion time, Hymns or Anthems such as the

		LAMB of God, that takest away the sin of

		O Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of

		O Lamb of God, that takest away the sin of

		If the consecrated Bread or Wine be all spent before all have
