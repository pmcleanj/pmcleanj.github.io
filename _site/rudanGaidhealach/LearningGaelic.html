<P CLASS="tiotal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>The Logrus philosophy of
Gaelic Learning</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Children learn their language by hearing it
over and over, observing the context in which words are used, and
inferring word meanings and the logic of the language from their
exposure to it – with no distraction from hearing a different
language. This is “immersion” in the language. It's extolled as
the most effective language-learning method, and we've nearly all
experienced success with it -- with our native language. It makes
sense that we will be successful using the same method to acquire our
heritage language. And so the myth is born nothing is required to
achieve fluency but immersion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As adults, however, we face additional
challenges. We have lost the “language plasticity” that is
natural to young children. We have jobs and social commitments that
require us to switch back to our dominant language. Few of us have
access to an exclusively Gaelic-speaking community, or to any
Gaelic-speaking community for that matter. And so the competing myth
is born that it is impossible for an adult to achieve true fluency.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Truth lies somewhere in between.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">As adult learners, we have the advantage of
understanding many of the basic building blocks of language. We know
about nouns and verbs, tenses and conjugation. We may have studied
French or Japanese and know that different languages have different
word-order and different ways of changing words to express context.
Gaelic has these distinctions too, so learning by studying grammar
builds on existing understanding. We already understand the value of
vocabulary and have practice expressing complex ideas, so we
understand the value of memorizing vocabulary lists. And in this age
of the internet, .mp3 files, and ear-buds we can ALSO use immersion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The best way to learn Gaelic is whatever way
works. Different techniques will build different strengths, and will
work in different circumstances. There's no reason to restrict
yourself to just one technique. Try everything, and keep up the
strategies that work for you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Some general advice does apply to all
strategies:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Learning depends on repetition,
	repetition, repetition. Whether you favour flashcards or podcasts,
	you'll need to go through them over and over. Relax, enjoy it, and
	persist. Repetition is more important than “moving on”.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lose your dignity. Studies show that
	children do NOT in fact learn foreign languages to fluency without
	formal teaching. What children have going for them is that they are
	not yet self-conscious about making mistakes, or appearing to be
	non-fluent through halting or stumbling speech. Fluency itself is a
	myth. It does not matter whether you are fluent, or know the right
	words. What matters is that you try to say SOMETHING. If Syrian
	refugees who have lost everything and landed in our
	hospitable-but-frozen homeland can find the courage to go
	grocery-shopping in English only within a month of arriving, we can
	surely manage to stammer out a halting sentence or two every time we
	meet a fellow Gaelic learner, even if we have to supplement our
	attempts with pantomime and dictionary look-ups. No Judgement! as
	long as you try.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Many language-acquisition experts
	recommend avoiding translation.Flashcards create associations in
	your mind. If you put an English word the back of the card, and a
	Gaelic word on the front, you'll associate the two words. You'll see
	an apple, think “Apple”, and associate it with “Uhl”. If you
	put a picture of the apple on the back of the card instead of the
	English word, your mind will build a direct association between the
	actual object and “Uhl”. Most flash-card apps will allow you to
	use pictures. </FONT>
