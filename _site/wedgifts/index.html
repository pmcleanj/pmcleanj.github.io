A wise couple will consider first, what household goods they already possess; next, what possessions would grace thier home of dreams; and finally what they wish to acquire, replace or dispose of, to bring the reality and dreams together. High standards and a long view will never be in error. </font><p><font size="+1">By all means, a bride should register. Much crass advice is given that registering helps guests choose appropriate gifts and prevents duplicate gifts. No gently-bred bride would dream of influencing her guests in this way; indeed, she expects no gifts at all. But registering greatly helps a bride plan the trousseau which, acquired over the years, will graciously complement her way of life. Good shops retain such records for many years -- and the very best shops will keep such a registry for a good customer of whatever marital status. </font><p><font size="+1">In planning tableware, consider how you will entertain. If you never serve a formal dinner, acquire only glassware, stoneware and stainless steel; if you never entertain casually, acquire only crystal, porcelaine and silver. Unused "Wedding China" is a silly affectation. Determine the minimum courses you will serve, and obtain first the pieces you will need for that, ignoring the china-shop's definition of a "place setting" (a china-shop's "place setting" contains five pieces, only two of which are correctly used at a formal dinner). Consider also how many guests you will sit down at one time: four, eight or twelve guests (in addition to the host and hostess) are pleasant numbers. </font><p><font size="+1">A young couple who are beginning to practice hospitality, will do well to try first simple three-course meals; first for one another, then for only four guests. Thus for soup, a meat course, and cake -- a gracious example -- they should have available: six each soup-plates, dinner-plates, glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each dinner-knives, dinner-forks, salad forks, and dessert spoons; six red-wine glasses; a soup-toureen, a platter, two vegetable dishes, and a cake plate; a soup ladle, carving knife and fork, two serving spoons and a cake knife. Alternately for a meat course, salad, and pudding they should have available: six each dinner-plates, salad plates, glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each soup-spoons, dinner-knives, dinner-forks, dessert forks; six red-wine glasses; a platter, two vegetable dishes, a salad bowl, and a pudding bowl; a carving knife and fork, two serving spoons, salad servers and a pudding spoon.</font><p><font size="+1">If one has acquired for each cover -- a "cover" being that which the china-shops call a "place setting" -- a large spoon, a large knife, and a large fork; the most versatile piece of cutlery to obtain next is a smaller fork, which may serve as a fish-fork, salad-fork, dessert-fork, or for the appetizer course. Dinner-plates, ten inches in diameter, are the most necessary piece of china; followed by eight-inch plates which may serve for salad, appetizer or dessert. Soup-plates are used only for soup and so may seem dispenable; but may be omitted only at the cost of omitting to serve soup. </font><p><font size="+1">A silver-chest which contains for each cover a soup-spoon, fish-knife and fish-fork, dinner-knife and dinner-fork, lunch-knife and lunch-fork, salad-fork, dessert-fork, dessert-spoon, tea-spoon, coffee-spoon and demitasse-spoon; and appropriate serving-pieces; will meet the most ambitious requirements of most couples. Similarly even the best-stocked china cupboard rarely contains more than soup-plates, cover-plates, ten-inch plates, six-inch plates, glass eight-inch plates, tea-cups and saucers, coffee-cups and saucers,demi-tasses and saucers, and three sets of eight-inch plates; and serving dishes.</font> <center><p><font size="-1">if you're looking for a church marriage in Calgary Alberta, see also: <a href="StSmarry.html">getting married at Saint Stephen's</a></font> </center> <center><p><font size="-1"><a href="denizens.html#pamela">Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center><p> <div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/sacdance/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;Next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Sacdance</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/wedgroom/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;Previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Wedgroom</span> </a></div></div></article><small> </small></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
