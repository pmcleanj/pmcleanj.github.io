A graying congregation with diminishing attendance, Emmanuel faced the problem of having to provide a children's programme, on any given Sunday, for “three to twelve children between the ages of three and twelve”. Even with a handful of volunteers taking turns teaching, it was a discouraging challenge. No-one wants to spend hours preparing a spiritual bible lesson only to find the only students were three-year-olds, or laying out twelve sets of suppolies for an exciting craft and have only one or two students use the materials. Teachers did not receive training. Different teachers, even using the same curriculum, taught with different emphasis and brought different class-room management styles. Not knowing what to expect from week to week, the children struggled with the materials and behaviour standards, which in turn frustrated teachers more – and volunteers less willing to recommit to the coming year.</P> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1">One of those frustrated teachers consulted me in hopes of addressing underlying causes. By then, I had been delivering the “children's chat” at the main church service for nearly a decade. However my experience working on children's programmes goes back to the 1970s. Over the years, appalled by Sunday-School curricula heavy in simple moralism and cut-and-paste theology; I experimented with different curricula, adapted, customized, and wrote lesson-plans from scratch. One of the more exciting programmes I investigated was Cavaletti's Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, described in her book <I><U>The Religious Potential of the Child</U></I>. So I was excited when, in 2003, a colleague implemented <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Godly Play</I></SPAN>, an American adaptation of Caveletti's programme, for her congregation. When I was approached for ideas, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Godly Play</I></SPAN> that came to mind as a possible solution to Emmanuel's Sunday School problem.</P> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; orphans: 1">First, though, I surveyed the parents of Emmanuel's children regarding what <I>they</I> felt were the most important characteristics for our children's programme. As the children's primary advocates, the people to whom God has entrusted God's little ones, parents and guardians must collaborate in establishing any children's ministry. With some dissent, most parents wanted the children's programme to overlap with the worship time so that they might avoid having to keep children quiet during the ministry of the Word. In addition, and with remarkable consistency, Emmanuel's parents answered that they wanted their children to</P> <OL> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; orphans: 1">learn Scripture;</P> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.1cm; orphans: 1">to be visible to, included in, and accepted by the greater congregation; and</P> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1">to praise God with song.</P> </OL> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">These principles are deeply rooted in Lutheran culture: “Sola Scriptura”, “the priesthood of all believers,” and Luther's appreciation of music. Clearly, such foundational cultural values cannot be set aside for the sake of a curriculum. And orthodox </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Godly Play</I></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">provides none of these! </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Godly Play</I></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">stories are highly paraphrased retellings of Bible stories rather than faithful translations from Scripture. </SPAN><I>Godly Play</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">takes place entirely in its own room with no transition from and to the nave where their family worships – and, presuming the children will be brought and picked up by their adults, must either beheld at a separate time from worship, or completely overlap worship such that the children are completely excluded from the worship service; and uses its own lesson cycle with no attempt to coordinate with the lectionary being used by the adult congregation. </SPAN><I>Godly Play</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">deliberately </SPAN>rejects the use of music in the <I>Godly Play</I> room, as being incompatible with the individual expression and deep personal quiet. Perhaps <I>Godly Play</I> is simply the wrong children's programme for this congregation.</P> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1"><A NAME="bc_0_9b+seedoCsFD"></A>And yet!... the paedagogical approach used by <I>Godly Play</I> is powerful, delighting the students and removing pressure from the teachers. Students in Montessori programmes remember what they have been taught, and are personally commited to what they have learned, in contrasts to strongly authoritarian instruction which sets up children to rebel against what they have learned when they reach their teens and young adulthood. Effectiveness, retention and personal commitment are exactly what we should be striving for in fulfilment of Scriptures command that we train up our children in the way they should go. We do not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater! So we adapted, and adapted heavily.The reader may judge for herself whether we have adapted <I>Godly Play</I> beyond recognition.</P> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1">Focussing on the principles for which parents themselves advocated, we made the following changes:</P> <UL> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>A “Pull-out” format:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"> This is not actually a “principle” and in fact runs contrary to my personal principles, which are that children and adults alike need both corporate worship, and both alike need appropriate theological study.But bringing children in to worship, sadly, often engenders the enmity of those who prefer an “adult-only” society; to the degree that, unless some form of child-care is provided during the service, attending church becomes an insurmountable challenge for many parents. That sad fact is a common communal sin of many congregations, and if congregations are to repent of that sin they must deliberately make opportunities to connect with the children. So the children begin each Sunday in the nave with their families, come to the chancel to hear their story, “journey” to their room for their own programme, and then return to the nave for communion and the blessing. Of course, this challenges us find creative ways to handle the transitions inherent in a 'pull-out' programme</SPAN></FONT></P> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Scripture: </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>Luther taught that each Christian finds their relationship to God through Scripture, unmediated by any priest or special theological training. Foremost, before all else, our Sunday School tells the stories of Holy Scripture, simply as they appear in the Bible. We do not try to force any interpretation into the stories. The great sweeping stories of Godly Play, taking up to twenty minutes to tell, would not fit into the six-minute slot allowed for the “children's chat” during the Sunday service. In their sweep, the Godly Play stories generally cover several weeks' worth of lectionary readings in a single story; but at the same time reword, abridge, paraphrase, and even revise the stories for the childrens' consumption. To add Biblical integrity, where possible we replaced the words of the Godly Play story with words taken directly from the Bible. We chose the Contemporary English Version (CEV) as the default translation because of its accessibility and simple vocabulary. We had to un-abridge and un-paraphrase the published Godly Play stories, making them much longer than the original twenty minutes, and then break them into appropriate six-minute segments</FONT></P> </UL> <UL> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Inclusion</B>: Adults, children, teens: all of us who are baptized are equally part of Christ's Body, equally members of “the priesthood of all believers.” In faithfulness to that understanding, we share the Story for each week with the whole church, telling it in front of the altar, where it serves to prepare the adults for the readings to come at the same time that it presents the children with the material for their Wondering. After church, parents and their children can share their responses to the same readings. The story we tell typically comes directly from the <A HREF="http://lectionary.library.vanderbilt.edu/">Revised Common Lectionary (RCL)</A> used by most mainline church congregations in North America, and rather than being a redundant add-on to the service, actually takes the place of one of the readings. We use the semi-continuous Old Testament readings, which take several weeks to tell each story. Several weeks' worth of six-minute segments provides adequate time to tell even Biblically-accurate versions of the great stories of our faith. Telling the Story in the church required us to invent a liturgical movement that would carry the children contemplatively into a new environmen. We recognized a new facet, the Journey.</FONT></P> <LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Worship</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>: Luther said “Music is an outstanding gift of God and next to theology. I would not give up my slight knowledge of music for a great consideration. And youth should be taught this art; for it makes fine skillful people.” Children respond in the same way as adults: through the arts, including <A HREF="http://sundayStoriesMusic.html/">music</A> – often the same very contemporary worship music being sung by their parents and grandparents. As the Church has done for centuries, we can use music to cover transitions: we sing while Journeying from the church to the Story Room, we learn our new song while “getting ready” in the hallway at the end of our Journey, and we sing a contemplative song while cleaning up and Journeying back to the church for communion to help sustain the deep sense of peace that developes during the children's Response to the story.</FONT></P> </UL> <P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 1"><FONT SIZE=3>We made substantial changes to </FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I>Godly Play,</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> driven by our need for Biblical integrity, inclusivity, and music. At the same time we retained, we hope, the benefits of Montessori techniques, informed by the work of Montessori religious educators Sophia Cavaletti (</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><U>The Religious Potential of the Child</U></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>; </FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><U>The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd</U></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>) Jerome Berryman (</FONT><U>“</U><FONT SIZE=3><I><U>Godly Play”, Young Children and Worship</U></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>) and Sonja Stewart (</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><U>Young Children and Worship</U></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, </FONT><FONT SIZE=3><I><U>Following Jesus: More About Young Children and Worship</U></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>.)

Their hunger is an opportunity for Christian to reclaim traditional holidays from Christian history that we can share to help meet their need for spiritual meaning, with Christ as the focal point of every tradition we restore. For the sake of those we serve, we must exhume our traditions out of history, and offer them to our world!</P> <P CLASS="western">The most significant historical holidays in addition to Easter and Christmas are Candlemas (February 2), Ladymas (March 25), Roodmas (May 3), Pentecost, StJeanmas (June 24), Lammas (August 1), Michaelmas (September 29), Hallowmas (November 1). In mediaeval times, these holidays enjoyed all the characteristics that make the difference between an unobserved &ldquo;Holy Day&rdquo; and a beloved holiday: public worship; story-telling; familiarity, tradition and nostalgia; shared community activities and a shared understanding of symbols; gift-giving, and special foods. Nowadays, these holidays&rsquo; traditions are no longer observed and are largely forgotten. But we can select, prayerfully, what traditions to reintroduce and how to reintroduce them in a way that reaches out to meet our neighbourhood&rsquo;s spiritual needs.</P> <P CLASS="western">Different traditional customs are documented for each of these, and most of those traditions can be re-cast in a modern setting, particularly as outreach events. We do need to recognize that offering such events will demand considerable commitment on the part of Emmanuel&rsquo;s people. We may well need to persist through two or three years of sparse attendance, to give the events time to catch on. But we can also expect considerable rewards, as these Holy Days&rsquo; traditions are inherently fun and meaningful. And we can expect to see Emmanuel grow as a church only if we are sincere in our commitment to outreach.</P> <P CLASS="western">To avoid taking on too much to soon, a modest proposal is presented, of adding two Holy-day celebrations to our calendar in 2007. The first of these, a Roodmas/Rogation celebration featuring a gardening lecture, plant-exchange and Maypole dance, is driven by the urgency of reaching out to new families moving in to the condominiums down the road. The second of these, a Lammas/Michaelmas celebration in late August, is driven by the need to reconnect with our Vacation Bible School families as they are returning from vacation and making their plans for the new school year. In subsequent years we would need to persist in offering these two events to allow attendance to build up, and might consider adding additional events to our schedule.</P> <P CLASS="western">A number of questions remain. Will these events actually appeal to the people of our neighbourhood? If we don&rsquo;t make the effort to offer such events, we will never know. Do these events speak deeply enough of Emmanuel&rsquo;s Christian heritage, that we can succeed in making them meaningful for unchurched people? And most of all, are we truly willing to put significant effort into reaching out to draw others to Jesus?</P> <P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.04in; page-break-before: always"><A NAME="OLE_LINK7"></A> <FONT SIZE=3>The Christian Liturgical Year: an opportunity for outreach</FONT></P> <P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.04in"><FONT SIZE=3>Contents</FONT></P> <DIV ID="Table of Contents1" DIR="LTR"> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>The Christian Liturgical Year: an opportunity for outreach 1</B></I></FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Summary 1</B></I></FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Summary 1</B></I></FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>The Christian Liturgical Year: an opportunity for outreach 2</B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-left: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Contents 2</B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Holidays and Seasons 3</B></I></FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Holidays and Seasons 3</B></I></FONT></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"> <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>From &ldquo;Holy Day&rdquo; to &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;?

For our ancestors, much wiser than we, those two days were only the brightest and best of a whole annual pattern of celebration and remembrance. For us, those two days have to support all the frenetic intensity of family obligation and consumerism that our ancestors spread over a dozen or more high holy-days. And so, especially for unchurched families, Easter and Christmas become unrewarding days of stress and conflict that leave folk emotionally depleted and still hungering for some sense of meaning. Easter and Christmas need to be redeemed, by restoring them to their proper place within a larger set of holy-days and celebrations.</P> <P CLASS="western">God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>. One or the other of God&rsquo;s two great lights: the Sun or the Moon, typically defines a calendar: our western &ldquo;Gregorian&rdquo; calendar is based on the Sun&rsquo;s cycle, for example, while the middle-eastern calendar of Islamic countries is based on the Moon&rsquo;s cycle. Both the solar and the lunar cycle combine to determine the holy days of the Christian Year, as is well illustrated by the two holy-days whose popular celebration still survives, Christmas and Easter.</P> <P CLASS="western">The Sun&rsquo;s cycle is defined by the axial tilt of the Earth. As Earth circles the Sun, its axial tilt results in summer with its longer days, and then winter with its shorter days. The longest day and the shortest day are obviously special, as are the two equinoxes half-way between. Our celebration of the shortest day of the year survives as Christmas<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>. The ancient church also had St Johnmas on the shortest night (June 24), and Ladymas (March 25) and Michaelmas (September 29) on the two equinoxes. In between each of these seasonal holy-days, the ancient church celebrated &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; days: Candlemas (February 2), Roodmas (May 3), Lammas (August 1) and Hallowmas (November 1).</P> <P CLASS="western">The Moon&rsquo;s cycle is defined by the waxing and waning of the moon as it goes from new moon to first quarter to full moon to third quarter to the dark of the moon. The phase of the moon determines the timing of Easter according to the following rule: Easter is the first Sunday after the first new moon after the spring equinox<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>. Easter in turn determines the timing of Pentecost, which is fifty days after Easter<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>, and Ash Wednesday, which is forty days before Easter<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>.</P> <P CLASS="western">In addition to these ancient holy-days written, as it were, by God Himself in the great lights of Creation, numerous &ldquo;Saints&rsquo; Days&rdquo; were celebrated by the medaeival. Some of these Saints&rsquo; Days honoured the Apostles and other biblical saints whose witness points persistently to Christ, but many overemphasised spurious saints and distracted from Christ. As we seek to reclaim for God the holiness of passing time, Christ must be the focal point of every tradition we restore.</P> <P CLASS="western">Our ancient Holy tradition of faith, then, gives us a wealth of nine seasonal holidays over the commercialised and secularised two. Such wealth can only have one proper use &ndash; to use it and expend it on God&rsquo;s work in the world. God&rsquo;s work sends us out to serve our city&rsquo;s an unchurched families and young adults, who often dabble in alternative traditions and new religions for the allure of their imported or made-up symbols and rituals. Those rituals are empty of grace, and can never satisfy such seekers; but in contrast the Church&rsquo;s rich historical traditions celebrate the ultimate grace of our salvation. But can seekers find those traditions in our church? Or, only in our history? For the sake of those we serve, we must exhume our traditions out of history, and offer them to our world! </P> <H1 CLASS="western">From &ldquo;Holy Day&rdquo; to &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;?</H1> <P CLASS="western">Easter and Christmas are unquestionably holidays. But on our Church Calendars they are recorded as &ldquo;Holy Days&rdquo; &ndash; as are Candlemas and Michaelmas and many other holy days that most people, especially unchurched people, have never heard of. What have Christmas and Easter got going for them, that those other holy days don&rsquo;t have? </P> <P CLASS="western">Maybe, the characteristics that make Easter and Christmas special can be named, and then made more general. Human nature being universal, they will be the same characteristics that make other holidays like Passover or Chinese New Year successful &ndash; and they will be lacking in holidays like &ldquo;Heritage Day&rdquo; and &ldquo;Labour Day&rdquo; that manifest as a day off work and nothing more. Once identified, those same characteristics could be &ldquo;custom-tailored&rdquo; for each of the holy days that we want to reclaim. So, what are the characteristics of a holiday?</P> <H3 CLASS="western">The Spiritual Dimension: Public Worship</H3> <P CLASS="western">Unique and focused worship services are always a part of Easter and Christmas. In theory, pecial services focusing on their commemorations &ndash; usually several. In theory, special services exist for many of the other Holy Days on our Calendar, but they are often ignored or have fallen into disuse, even in more centralized churches that have church rules supposedly requiring that such services be held. Easter and Christmas services are easily scheduled with the expectation that the statutory holiday will leave the people free to attend worship. Services for other holidays will have to be scheduled in the evening or transferred to an adjacent weekend, in order to offer people the opportunity to attend.</P> <P CLASS="western">In the case of events meant to reach out to the community, Mary Green has strongly recommended holding the events outside the church building proper. She has noticed that outdoor event attract far more people than do indoor events. Our unchurched neighbours are often unfamiliar with churches in general and uncomfortable going into such an unfamiliar place. And, of course, passers-by cannot tell what kind of event is going on if all they see is cars in the parking lot. If as they drive or walk by they see crowds celebrating, they are more likely to join in to the current event, or perhaps the next event.</P> <P CLASS="western">If we accept Mary&rsquo;s recommendation, then worship associated with these events should be truly public &ndash; held out of doors along with the event. It should be short, up-beat, and highly targeted on the Christian tradition being celebrated. It should avoid &ldquo;churchy&rdquo; buzzwords, but we should not be hesitant about showing off our symbols or spirituality: these, after all, are what our neighbours hunger for. But any symbols we use in such outreach worship should be explained. Being &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; about symbols and traditions creates a sense of belonging, which may in time encourage these neighbours to cross the threshold of the church building itself.</P> <P CLASS="western">A brief out-door worship service can create a focus for whatever event we hold. In the wall-less venue of our parking lot, such a focus is necessary to keep people from drifting back out onto the sidewalk and pathways and drifting away. A certain concentration of social energy must be maintained to keep any event going. So a Master of Ceremonies of some kind &ndash; with a public address system -- is needed. The MC&rsquo;s job is to gather together all the visitors to the event, let them know what is going on and what&rsquo;s expected, and create a sense of hospitality. The public worship should fit into the event plan as an understate-but-formal way of managing the focus of the event. </P> <H3 CLASS="western">Story-Telling</H3> <P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Easter and Christmas are all about telling stories. The Christmas pageant and the Maundy foot-washing service and the Christmas pageant tell through drama how Christ was born and how He gave us his &ldquo;new commandment&rdquo;. The service of Carols and Lessons tells through reading scripture the story of how Christ&rsquo;s birth was fortold. The Good Friday reading tells us the whole story of Christ&rsquo;s betrayal and condemnation.</P> <P CLASS="western">At home, we read stories like &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo; and watch TV specials that reiterate in a worldly context the stories of the holidays we are participating in. Through stories, we teach one another what these holidays celebrate. Over and over we find ways of communicating &ldquo;the true meaning&rdquo; of Christmas and Easter.</P> <P CLASS="western">If people are to learn the true meaning of other Holy Days, then we must teach those stories. And we must use the most powerful methods of teaching, since the stories are so unfamiliar. Reading aloud from Scripture won&rsquo;t work in outreach work, in part because we often fail to make the story come alive because of our own awareness that what we are reading is Scripture, in part because Scripture often sounds dated and artificial to unchurched people, and in part because the physical act of reading prevents eye-contact and creates a distance between reader and audience.</P> <P CLASS="western">Powerful teaching takes the form of drama, of oral story-telling with repetition and with figures of speech tying in to the hearer&rsquo;s own experience, and of participative activities that illustrate the story. For every event that we put on, one or more forms of powerful storytelling should have a role in the event.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">The Historic Dimension: Tradition and Nostalgia</H3> <P CLASS="western">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done this twice now, so it&rsquo;s a tradition!&rdquo; People love to know what is about to happen. They love to feel in touch with their heritage and to be part of something bigger than themselves. They will find themselves drawn more to a &ldquo;second annual&rdquo; &ndash; or even a &ldquo;first annual&rdquo; &ndash; event than to the same event that doesn&rsquo;t include those words. An activity framed with an explanation of its traditional roots has more appeal than the same activity divorced from a traditional explanation. But most of all, an activity that can be remembered from previous years without a gap has more appeal than a novel or sporadic activity. This is why, in many congregations, a special event that is sparsely attended in the first year or two becomes an expected regular event if only the organizers have the persistence to keep it up in the face of limited early participation.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">The Community Dimension: Shared Symbols and Activities</H3> <P CLASS="western">The symbols of Easter and Christmas are all around us in society. Even corrupted by materialism, those symbols reinforce our holiday spirit. When our families gather from far-flung destinations to share the celebration with us, that further reinforces our holiday spirit. Nothing touches us so poignantly, as the thought of someone celebrating Christmas alone.</P> <P CLASS="western">Paul wrote to the Corinthians that they should &ldquo;remember to practice hospitality.&rdquo; Even though we cannot expect our relatives to travel home a dozen times a year to celebrate holidays with us, we can invite community members to share activities and meals with us.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">Gift-giving</H3> <P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">In modern culture, gift-giving is almost synonymous with Christmas. But Easter has its Easter baskets too, Hallowe&rsquo;en has its relatively trivial gifts to the neighbourhood trick-or-treators, and even Valentine&rsquo;s day has its little cards.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">The Carnal dimension: Special Food!</H3> <P CLASS="western">Saint Paul tells us that everything God has given is good, but not necessarily good for us. This duality is often incorporated in successful holidays, by being preceded by a fast or time of abstinence: Easter by Lent, Christmas by Advent, Passover by Rosh Hashanah; Eid by Ramadan. The other half of the duality, of course, are the wonderful distinctive foods that are associated with each holiday: the Easter Ham, the Thanksgiving Turkey, the Christmas Pudding -- foods that are made more special by being reserved for their proper holiday.</P> <H1 CLASS="western">The Christian Year</H1> <P CLASS="western">The most significant historical Holy Days in the Christian year -- in addition to Easter and Christmas -- are Candlemas (February 2), Ladymas (March 25), Roodmas (May 3), Pentecost, StJeanmas (June 24), Lammas (August 1), Michaelmas (September 29), Hallowmas (November 1). Some of these days are already celebrated within the family of our church, and may be better opportunities for strengthening new Christians than for reaching out to others &ndash; remembering that new Christians, as much as seekers, may yearn for rich symbolic ways to express their new faith. Other days, especially those timed around some shared human experience, may be better for reaching out to the community. We can select, prayerfully, what traditions to reintroduce and how to reintroduce them in a way that best meets the neighbourhood&rsquo;s spiritual needs. </P> <H2 CLASS="western">Christmas (December 25)</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Nativity of Our Lord&rdquo;. We do a good job already of attracting the &ldquo;Christmas and Easter&rdquo; Christians to church to one of the Christmas Eve services, and the four weeks of Advent with their focus on the Advent Wreath help provide balance to the season. We could do more, by remembering that Christmas itself is twelve days long, and lasts past the first (and sometimes second) Sunday after December 25. These are the days &ndash; not the Sundays in Advent &ndash; when we appropriately sing Christmas carols and luxuriate in the nostalgia of Christmas past. Why not hold the lovely service of Carols and Lessons routinely on the first or second Sunday in Christmas, and invite our neighbours to share that well-known service while they are still in a nostalgic and church-friendly mood? Or, perhaps, go caroling in the neighbourhood and take the carols and lessons out into the community?</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Candlemas (February 2 &ndash; a Saturday in 2008</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of &ldquo;Candlemas&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Presentation of Christ in the Temple&rdquo;. Like Christmas, it is a scriptural feast-day and a &ldquo;feast of Light&rdquo;. It celebrates the day, forty days after the birth of their first son, that Mary and Joseph came to the temple to sacrifice two small birds. This was the occasion on which Anna and Simeon prophesied over the Christ-child, and Simeon proclaimed in his famous song that Jesus would be &ldquo;A light to lighten the Gentiles, And the glory of thy people Israel.&rdquo; On this day, the ancient church blessed the candles that would be used in worship for the coming year. The people would bring their own candle and light it from the church-candles, to carry &ldquo;the light of Christ&rdquo; home to their own homes.</P> <P CLASS="western">On February 2, I cook a &ldquo;feast&rdquo; of two small birds with rice, in a crock-pot or slow oven and invite friends or neighbours to join us for dinner. All the candles in the house are placed on the dining-room table, and all the lights t are turned off. Then after school and work we take candle lanterns, one for each family-member and dinner-guest and go &ndash; preferably to church, but since our church to doesn&rsquo;t hold Candlemas services &ndash; to the home of one of our dinner-guests. There, we read the story of the Presentation, pray, and light our candles. From there we process home together, singing hymns about Light and Fire, such as &ldquo;this little light of mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Revival Fire Fall&rdquo;. When we get home, we take turns lighting the candles on the dining-table. As each candle is lit, we recite the names of a family or other community group that we are praying for. And when all the candles are lit, we turn on lights, blow out candles, clear and reset the table, and start the feast. Then, of course, we all watch Groundhog Day on DVD.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">A Candlelight Procession</H3> <P CLASS="western">The church is a far more appropriate venue for a brief February 2 Service of the Word with candle-lighting. If kept very brief or if the weather is very warm, the service could be held on the Church porch. It might be a good idea to use the service also to rehearse one or two appropriate hymns, since many people may not have such hymns memorized and &ldquo;on tap&rdquo;. But just imagine the visual impact on the community, of a little crowd of singing Christians fanning out from the churchyard carrying their candle-lanterns!</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Ladymas (March 25 &ndash; a Tuesday in 2008)</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of Ladymas is &ldquo;The Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary&rdquo; &ndash; but don&rsquo;t mistake it as a festival focusing on Mary. What was being announced was the coming of Christ, so this is a festival focused on the Lord himself.</P> <P CLASS="western">But it&rsquo;s also in the middle of Lent, at the very end of Winter, at a time when all fresh food is long-since stale or eaten; and the delights of fresh breezes and the occasional birdsong must take the place of riotous feasting. In ancient times craftspeople who had spent the winter at their handwork grasped this first opportunity to travel to find a fair and sell their product, and housewives threw wide the shutters to let out the smell and grime of six months&rsquo; peatsmoke; leaving Ladymas associated primarily with market-fairs and spring cleaning.</P> <P CLASS="western">In our family I&rsquo;ve set aside &ldquo;Lady Tarts&rdquo; -- a special small pastry made of raspberry jam, almond custard, and sweet meringue &ndash; as Ladymas&rsquo; special food.</P> <P CLASS="western">In 2008 we see the very unusual situation, where Ladymas falls in Easter week, something that could never have happened prior to the Gregorian calendar reform. When Ladymas falls in either Holy Week or Easter Week, it is traditionally not observed. So, this may be a neighbourhood celebration that we can &ldquo;phase in&rdquo; in a subsequent year.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">Lady-Day Faire</H3> <P CLASS="western">Why not combine the ideas of market-fairs and spring cleaning to hold a neighbourhood garage sale in the parking lot. Invite neighbours to come and set up a card-table, sell their wares and pocket their profits. Church groups could sell bazaar crafts or food. Other church-groups could set up ministry-fair style booths to advertise Sunday School, the coming Vacation Bible School (working mothers do start planning summer out-of-school care as early as march) and so on. Build on the motif of a Lady-Day Faire by having the worship team as modern minstrels, and story-tellers to tell the story of, among other things, just what Lady Day is.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Easter</H2> <P CLASS="western">We already have a wonderful celebration of Easter, with our sunrise worship, parish breakfast, and Easter worship. And Easter like Christmas is a day when the church is so full of &ldquo;Easter-and-Christmas&rdquo; Christians that we wouldn&rsquo;t have room for our unchurched neighbours, even if we could persuade them to come in. </P> <P CLASS="western">However, the traditional Church celebrated Easter nearly continuously from Palm Sunday until Easter. On Wednesday in Holy Week the traditional service of &ldquo;Tenebrae&rdquo; is held, dramatically illustrating the growing spiritual darkness as we draw near to Good Friday. On Thursday, a four-part service may be held, starting with the commemoration of Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Commandment&rdquo; which He illustrated by washing the disciples&rsquo; feet, then a shared Agape meal recapitulating a Seder meal, then the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper that Christ instituted on this day, and finally the stripping of the Altar. On Good Friday is the Way of the Cross and often additional solemn worship. Then on Saturday night is held the a candlelight service called the &ldquo;Great Vigil of Easter&rdquo;.</P> <P CLASS="western">The Saturday-night candlelight service, and our sunrise service on Easter Morning, are actually two ends of the same tradition. In the ancient church, believers would gather on Saturday night to wait together for the promise of Easter. There they would kindle a new fire, light candles from it, and in the quiet candlelight as they kept vigil, they would recount the great stories of God&rsquo;s saving grace throughout history: of God&rsquo;s preserving Noah through the flood, of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham, of the Exodus, of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophetic witness to Christ. As the adult believers prayed, retold scriptures, and kept watch; the church&rsquo;s children dozed or heard the stories that would shape their faith. Finally, as sunrise marked the horizon, new believers would be baptized and the whole congregation would celebrate their Easter communion together.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">Maundy Thursday Agape Meal</H3> <P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Emmanuel currently has a Maundy Thursday service, and long-term parishioners recount that we have held an Agape meal in the past. We should consider restoring the custom. Although it is unlikely that unchurched people from the neighbourhood would come for the meal, we could expect it to appeal to new members attracted by other outreach events, and to old members who can always afford to be strengthened by fellowship and by participating in our shared story. A &ldquo;Christian Seder&rdquo; is probably not the best choice for such a meal, as it involves considerable work and can be offensive to our Jewish neighbours. A simple candlelight meal of bread and wine, milk and honey, apples and raw-vegetable &ldquo;herbs&rdquo; captures the most essential symbols of the Passover story with minimal effort.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">Good Friday Fasting and Hot-cross Buns</H3> <P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Fasting is not much taught as a spiritual discipline, at Emmanuel. It is certainly not an appropriate vehicle for outreach! But, as with the Thursday Agape meal, it can be an excellent step in the Christian formation of new and old members. An old tradition is to fast until the end of the Good Friday service, which traditionally lasted a long time, from noon until three in the afternoon. Then at the end of the service, the children at least (and why not the adults, too?) would break their fast on freshly baked hot spicy buns marked with, a reminder of the spices that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus took to Jesus&rsquo; tomb. Of course, it is much less of a fast if it only lasts until the end of a short morning service. But even so, Emmanuel&rsquo;s members might well benefit from sound teaching on the value of fasting, some encouragement to fast for even those few hours on Good Friday morning, and a tray of hot buns fresh from Emmanuel&rsquo;s oven at the end of the Good Friday service.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">Easter Eve Campfire and Bedtime-stories</H3> <P CLASS="western">In every culture, stories told around the fire are part of how we transcend our own generation and pass our culture to our children. Could we use this holy night, and the magical allure of the new fire, to pass on our faith to our spiritually hungry neighbours? Could we offer their children an evening of stories around the fire, timed to precede bedtime and accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate?</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Roodmas (May 3) and Rogation Day</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name for roodmas is &ldquo;The Exaltation of the Holy Cross&rdquo;, and it is said to commemorate the date in 326 when workers found a wooden beam claimed to be the True Cross<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>. But it is more likely that Roodmas was already being celebrated in Northern Europe as a spring sowing festivals, featuring the Maypole. The Maypole is &ldquo;the tree of life&rdquo; &ndash; which is, after all, exactly what the cross is. A small cross-bar at the top of a Christian Maypole anchors the ribbons to the pole &ndash; and reminds us all that the Resurrection has transformed an instrument of brutal death into a beautiful symbol of blessing, life and plenty.</P> <P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Rogation&rdquo; means &ldquo;solemn prayer&rdquo;. Rogation Day is the fifth Sunday after Easter, and in pre-industrial times it was traditionally a day of prayer for the harvest, whose seeds should have just been sown. But in Alberta, with our short growing season and late frosts, sowing the harvest cannot move back and forth with the phases of the moon, so the traditional timing of Rogation Day is as meaningless as is, to most people&rsquo;s vocabulary, the word &ldquo;Rogation&rdquo; itself. For that matter, in our highly urban society, most people have forgotten that the harvest needs to be sown and that we eat, come the fall, only at the mercy of our Father.</P> <P CLASS="western">BUT &ndash; especially in our highly urban society, people are healthier when they are in touch with the earth. A disproportionately high number of urbanites are gardeners, if often ineffectual ones. </P> <H3 CLASS="western">The Blessing of the Gardens</H3> <P CLASS="western">Canadians have a well-defined day for our gardening, with Victoria Day as a statutory holiday on which to celebrate it<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>. Right now, our church is seeing new condominiums springing up in the formerly vacant land around us, and new families moving in seeking to set down roots &ndash; both literally and figuratively, by starting their first-ever gardens. Many of them may not count established gardeners among their friends, from whom they can expect divisions of established perennials or good advice about what will or won&rsquo;t grow in Calgary. So why not sponsor a speaker from the Zoo or the horticultural society, to give a short outdoor lecture on &ldquo;windowbox and small-plot gardening&rdquo;. Established gardeners could come and trade perennials or cuttings and recycle some old plant-pots; and extras could be given away to new gardeners just starting out. We could ask the pastor to open or close the party with a short service of the Word, and ask God&rsquo;s blessing on our city&rsquo;s gardens and our province&rsquo;s farmlands.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Pentecost</H2> <P CLASS="western">Pentecost commemorates commemorating the day when the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believers. Pentecost means &ldquo;fifty days&rdquo;, and occurred as a harvest festival in the Old Testament, fifty days after Passover. For us, its commemoration occurs fifty days after Easter, though unlike the Mediterreanian with its three harvests a year, northern Europe and Canada never see a harvest so early.</P> <P CLASS="western">Because this is the &ldquo;birthday of the Church&rdquo;, its an appropriate day for nurturing our members rather than for outreach. On Pentecost day many congregations encourage members to wear red &ndash; for the Fire of the Holy Spirit &ndash; and serve birthday cake during coffee. Because the Gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out on the first Pentecost, it&rsquo;s a traditional day for Baptisms and Confirmations, where the Holy Spirit is poured out on new or maturing Christians. From this &ndash; and from the tradition of catechumens&rsquo; and confirmands&rsquo; wearing white &ndash; Pentecost is also called &ldquo;Whitsunday&rdquo;.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">StJohnmas (June 24)</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of StJohnmas (pronounced &ldquo;SINjinmas&rdquo;) is &ldquo;The Nativity of Saint John the Baptist&rdquo;. In Canada, particularly Quebec, it has been celebrated as a national festival; but traditionally it was celebrated as a counterpoint to Christmas, like the modern &ldquo;Christmas in July&rdquo; celebrations that have sprung up in recent years.</P> <P CLASS="western">In counterpoint to Christmas when the family gathers indoors around their Christmas Tree, at StJeanmas the family gathers outdoors around a bonfire. An important feature is to be able to offer refreshment and hospitality to passers-by. Our family bakes bannock on sticks over an open fire &ndash; wrapped in bacon for an extra treat!.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Lammas (August 1)</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of Lammas is &ldquo;The Feast of First Fruits&rdquo;. This is the first of three harvest-thanksgiving feasts from Northern Europe. Of the eight traditional solar-cycle feasts, it is the only one that makes no effort to commemorate any event from Our Lord&rsquo;s life: it is a pure harvest thanksgiving, timed to the very beginning of harvest, as berries and small fruits begin to become available. </P> <P CLASS="western">Our Saskatoon bushes and non-king cherries dutifully come ripe on this day; and we celebrate with a &ldquo;lammas pudding&rdquo; for dessert, made of bread stuffed with fresh berries molded and chilled, and then served with whipped cream. </P> <P CLASS="western">Gardens are generally at their best and in full bloom by this time, so a garden-party is an appropriate Lammas-day celebration. It could be combined with &ldquo;Heritage Day&rdquo; and take advantage of the Heritage Day statutory holiday. Why not celebrate our overtly Christian heritage? We could go further, and showcase the Danish, German, Norwegian and Swedish traditions that enrich our Lutheran form of Christianity. By advertising a &ldquo;Heritage Day Garden Party&rdquo; to our secular neighbours, we would be taking advantage of the shared experience of Heritage Day simultaneously being advertised for other city events.</P> <H3 CLASS="western">An End-of-Summer Garden Party</H3> <P CLASS="western">But in Calgary, many families are away on vacation and August is our &ldquo;lazy time&rdquo;, when few people are interested in making the effort to attend organized events, and Mary Green has suggested that what we really need is an event just as school is starting back up, to reconnect with our Vacation Bible School families as they return from summer vacation. So, another option would be to combine Lammas with Michaelmas and have a garden-party half-way between the two, drawing in traditions from both historic holy days.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Michaelmas (September 29)</H2> <P CLASS="western">The proper name of Michaelmas is &ldquo;The Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels&rdquo;. This is the second harvest festival, marking the end of the grain harvest and the start of the large fruits and winter-vegetable harvest. What it commemorates, however, is the victory in heaven of Michael and all Angels over the great beast that was cast out of heaven. In mediaeval church art, the Archangel Michael is often shown with a wounded dragon at his feet. </P> <P CLASS="western">Michaelmas (pronounced &ldquo;mikklemas&rdquo;), falling at the autumn equinox, is counterpoint to Ladymas. It&rsquo;s the traditional start to the school term in England, and in mediaeval times also often featured a fall Harvest faire; and mummery or guising. Guising involved dressing up as saints and biblical characters to travel from house to house putting on miniature passion plays, and was a sophisticated form of begging.</P> <P CLASS="western">Our family&rsquo;s Michaelmas tradition features a large dragon-shaped apple pie. We support our angelic heavely allies in their war upon the dragon by biting it with our teeth and digesting it in our bellies, in support of our allies in heaven. We have a box of special dress-up clothes that come out only for Michaelmas, and the children are encouraged to produce an impromptu play dramatizing the story of the War in the Heavenlies or some other scriptural theme.</P> <P CLASS="western">One congregation I know put on a &ldquo;Mediaeval Banquet&rdquo; for several years. This was a full-dinner ticketed event with food and entertainment styled on the twelfth century and full of good fun. The props from the event are still around and have been shared since by other churches putting on their own version of the events. Although it takes considerable effort, a Mediaeval Banquet would be an excellent way for a congregation to showcase Michaelmas while having a great deal of fun.</P> <H2 CLASS="western">Hallowmas (November 1)</H2> <P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Hallow&rdquo; means &ldquo;Holy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Saint&rdquo;; and Hallowmas is better known to us &ldquo;All Saints Day&rdquo;. Its Eve is better-known still, as Hallowe'en. The Hallowe'en theme of ghosties and dead spirits recognizes, however coarsely, that all the departed saints continue to be with us within the communion of saints. In North America, we have borrowed the custom of guising -- including the door-to-door begging that accompanied mediaeval guising &ndash; from Michaelmas. Guising isn&rsquo;t originally a Hallowmas custom, and we&rsquo;ve certainly lost the scriptural focus of mediaeval guising! Alas, we have also lost any sense of commemorating the Saints and instead allowed a vulgar focus on gore and the macabre to take over the day. The secularization of Hallowe&rsquo;en is an urgent warning of what might happen to that other most beloved holiday were we to fail at keeping the &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; in &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s put the &ldquo;Hallow&rdquo; back in &ldquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en&rdquo;.</P> <P CLASS="western">Anything that commemorates the faithful departed -- whether ancient Saints whom you revere, or recent saints who are dear at a more personal level, is a good celebration of All Saints. We can bake and share family recipes that were specialties of now-dead relatives. We can take some flowers or flowerseeds to tend some of the abandoned graves in the old graveyard by the Stampede grounds. </P> <H3 CLASS="western">A Children&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en/Harvest Party</H3> <P CLASS="western">At the same time, a growing trend in the inner cities is for children to attend safe Hallowe&rsquo;en or parties (in fundamentalist churches often called &ldquo;fall harvest&rdquo; parties in opposition to the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; roots they misperceive in Halloween). Trick-or-treating is a dwindling custom in many neighbourhoods. If children are going to abandon trick-or-treating in favour of indoor parties anyway, Emmanuel may be well advised to invite our neighbourhood children to a party here. Certainly Hallowe&rsquo;en is another holiday where we can take advantage of our culture&rsquo;s existing strong shared symbols, while restoring the Christian understanding of &quot;All Saints&rdquo;. </P> <H1 CLASS="western">Proposal</H1> <P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Our church is well located to attract neighbourhood families to special events several times a year. Such events could draw on Christian tradition to centre around the life of Our Lord, while speaking into the every-day experience of secular and unchurched Calgarians. Many of these traditions being unfamiliar to Emmanuel, we should move slowly and patiently, adding only one or two such events to our repertoire each year, until we are fully celebrating the Church Year and sharing those celebrations with our neighbours. A full cycle of Holy-Day celebrations might comprise:</P> <UL> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a Candlemas Procession,</P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a Lady-Day Faire, </P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a combined Roodmas/Rogation festival, </P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a StJohnmas: Christmas-in-June party, </P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a combined Lammas/Michaelmas festival, perhaps if the &ldquo;Lady-Day Faire&rdquo; is successful, done as a Michaelmas faire</P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a Hallowmas/Reformation festival, and</P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">additional balancing outreach at Christmas (Carols and Lessons in the community)</P> <LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">additional balancing outreach at Easter (Easter Eve stories and campfire)</P> </UL> <P CLASS="western">These special Holy-day celebrations, which would be new to Emmanuel, cannot be launched all at once. They should be added a couple each year, and then maintained from year to year to create a sense of expectation, both in the neighbourhood and in the Emmanuel community. Some immediate needs may drive which events we choose to resource first: the new condominiums North of the church are filling with new families that have never before gardened, and our Vacation Bible School this summer is expected to bring us new families that we will want to try to re-engage with some event prior to the start of school in the fall.</P> <P CLASS="western">A number of questions remain. Will these Holy Days actually appeal to the people of our neighbourhood? If we don&rsquo;t make the effort to offer such events, we will never know. Do these events speak deeply enough of Emmanuel&rsquo;s Christian heritage, that we can succeed in making them meaningful for unchurched people? And most of all, are we truly willing to put significant effort into reaching out to draw others to Jesus?</P> <DIV ID="sdfootnote1"> <P CLASS="sdfootnote-western"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A> Genesis 1:14; NIV</P> </DIV> <DIV ID="sdfootnote2"> <P CLASS="sdfootnote-western"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A> At least, December 25 USED to be on the solstice.

I can find the white and the pink, but am unable to find a deep pink/red/purple one for Christmas. I know the Lutheran Church in our area uses blue and white. I think the minister said it had something to do with separating Advent and Lent so the colors didn't confuse people? ## Answer: Hmm, white and pink with a red Christmas candle is a new combination for me... I'm used to four purples and a white, with the radical Catholic part of me leaning toward three purples, a pink, and a white. Some Swedish Lutherans -- the inventors of the Advent Wreath -- are surprised that the candles are any colour but white. And many Lutherans use four blue candles. My Metis mother-in-law uses Red, Yellow, Blue and Green because those are the colours of the Four Corners of the Earth on a Medicine Wheel. The advent wreath is just a custom, not a doctrine or tradition, so do whatever works to create more reverence and devotion in your home. Blue paraments is a Lutheran thing -- and good liturgy, since purple is for penance, and Advent is more preparatory than penitential (although all preparation has a penitential aspect). It does have some historical basis, along with other obscure colours like rose-pink paraments for festivals of the Blessed Virgin and black paraments for Ash Wednesday; although I don't know whether any of those less-common colours have historical basis in the non-Roman catholic churches.<li><h2><a href="/Everyday-Holiness/">Everyday Holiness</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HTTP-EQUIV="CONTENT-TYPE" CONTENT="text/html; charset=windows-1252"> <TITLE>Everyday Holiness: Living the Christian year.</TITLE> <META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="OpenOffice.org 1.1.3 (Win32)"> <META NAME="CREATED" CONTENT="20031209;21111386"> <META NAME="CHANGEDBY" CONTENT="Pamela Mclean"> <META NAME="CHANGED" CONTENT="20031209;22272151"> <STYLE> <!-- @page { size: 21.59cm 27.94cm } TD P { color: #008000 } H1 { color: #008000 } P { color: #008000 } A:link { color: #ffcc00 } A:visited { color: #ffff00 } --> </STYLE> </HEAD> <BODY LANG="en-US" TEXT="#008000" LINK="#ffcc00" VLINK="#ffff00" BGCOLOR="#e6e6ff" DIR="LTR"> <H1><BR><BR> </H1> <P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=6>Everyday Holiness</FONT></FONT></P> <P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR> </P> <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt">Since the third day of creation, the sun and moon have ruled over day and night, hours and seasons.

Reclaim it for Christ by scheduling the first family barbecue or picnic of the year. Try a May pole, if you're brave, and use the liturgical colours (red, white, purple and green) for the ribbons.

Celebrate any Baptism or Confirmation anniversaries in your family by lighting Baptismal Candles, inviting Godparents to dinner, and serving special foods or a decorated cake. This is the time to put away Easter decorations and Easter customs, and return to the everyday work of being in Christ. At Pentecost, the focus of the Christian year shifts from the life of Christ to the life of the Church. Use the less hectic days of summer to re-examine your Rule of Life (as described in the Prayer Book), and bring your personal ministries into line with your baptismal covenant.

Sometimes, though, I am glad when they don't ask... In this case, I heard the news at the filling station, while trying to put enough pressure into the two flat front tires (which I discovered when I got to the Wanda-Wagon this morning) to allow me to limp to the tire-shop without damaging the rim. The station attendant came and told me the news. Since Wanda is a rag-top the children heard what he was saying, though his agitation and heavy accent garbled the message somewhat. So they asked me to explain what he had said. I was still trying to make sense of it myself -- I told them that two air-liners had crashed, which is what I thought he had said. The girls are aviation buffs, after their father; they realized the seriousness of that. (I never dreamed I'd be wishing that was *all* it had been.) When Dean picked us all up at the tire shop, he had the radio on, so they heard the news as we did. We kept turning it off for a minute to re-state it for the children and allow them to ask questions, which we answered as simply and factually as we could. I wept through a couple of the answers, apart from which I tried to stay matter-of-fact. I several times used the words "I don't know why. It was wrong and evil." They talked about it a little in school; the school like us believes in giving children facts and letting them explore together the meaning and implications of those facts. Rachel's class, the grade two/threes, came to a consensus that the people who did it had done very wrong, but that they were dead, too. When I picked her up from school, she seemed comfortable with that. She recognised that I was still sad and worried, and hugged me protectively. Anne's class (grade four/five) seems mostly to have skirted the matter of motivation. She seemed less comfortable with it. She didn't talk about it, but at dinner she made a rude and challenging comment to something DH said about the event (he had been talking about the emergency response teams). I explained to her that the people he had been talking about had gone into the building to save others, and had been killed, willfully giving their lives to save others -- and that many of them were parents who would not come home. She got somber, and didn't say anything else. I think it may take her a long time to process this; maybe I came down too hard on her. Navigating through Anne's obsessiveness and hyper-restraint, without under-challenging her or letting her armour herself with flippancy, may be the biggest challenge of my parenting.<li><h2><a href="/ivillage/explaining-9-11-in-Sunday-School/">Explaining 9 11 In Sunday School</a></h2><p><p>##I’m wondering how to handle it if the attacks come up in Sunday School…<li><h2><a href="/xmas2000/">Xmas2000</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"><meta name="Author" content="Pamela Mclean"><meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.72 [en] (WinNT; U) [Netscape]"><meta name="Description" content="A School Christmas Pageant for 5 principal actors, and five groups or classes.

It is desirable if a red filter can be placed over the centre-stage spot for vignette #1. The second spot is used to bring the focus back to Leah and Bridget, and should be relatively dim since they are supposed to be hiding in an unlit alley. In vignette #2, however, the second spot is also used to draw the focus to the lighting of the menorah which shows the passage of time, after which it will go back to focussing on Bridget and Leah. If lights are not available, Bridget and Leah should point centre stage when the action starts there and maybe say "Look" as though they are seeing a magical vision, to redirect the audience's focus to centre stage. Bridget and Leah should then sit as still as possible during the vignette. At the end of the vignette, the vignette actors can simply leave the stage, and Bridget and Leah begin moving and speaking again.</font></font> <center><h3> Prelude: December 24 2000 CE, an alley</h3></center> <center><i>The stage is dark.

But in a few months it will be summer here, and then it will be winter in South Africa.<tr><td>Bridget:<td>Is it always that way?<tr><td>Leah:<td>Always. Even in the days of the cavemen.

"You should go".<p>"I'm not even Lutheran", I protested. "I'm not the right person."<p>"Doesn't matter", said Diane. "You should go." She looked significantly at Dean. "<i>One</i> of you should go".<p>"Dean should go" I said. He's the musician, he would fit right in. Dean rolled his eyes. He doesn't &#8216;do&#8217; conferences. I glanced at the brochure: Welcoming Children to Worship; Hospitality: a Worship Issue; Sacred Circle Dance -- the passions of my heart. "Dean should go", I said again, weakly.<p>Actually, it didn't look like either of us could go. I had to travel on business; Dean's car broke down. Yet somehow -- without even a road map, not knowing what awaited us in Camrose &#8211; August 19 finds us driving north. Navigating by transmission lines, I find Augustana College. Instantly, we feel welcome. Volunteers wave us in, help us register; drive us over to our rooms. Although we can't find our "task group", we don't feel lost: Pastor Marty Tuer quickly incorporates Anne and Rachel into her "Way of the Cross" task group. Dean and I join in the meditations and responses. The spirit of worship and belonging seeps through the cracks in my Anglican reserve. We have been "gathered in".<p>In the chapel that first evening, familiar music washed over the conference congregation. The conference presenters were Marty Haugen and Susan Briehl. Marty Haugen is familiar by his rich contributions to our worship music: <i>As the Grains of Wheat</i>, <i>Sing Out Earth and Skies</i>; <i> Beneath the Tree of Life</i>; and of course <i>Gather Us In</i>. In subsequent presentations Marty would explain the role of music within the Lutheran tradition, and how to ensure that music stays true to the substance of Lutheran thought. In this first service, he was content to allow massed voices demonstrate music's role in stunning four-part harmony, overwhelming my senses. Though familiar with the austere beauty of unison plainchant or the well-rehearsed tones of a cathedral choir, I had never heard such congregational music as I heard that night. Throughout the conference which ran from Saturday to the following Wednesday, lectures and explanations greatly deepened my awareness of the role of music in Lutheran faith; and I would be impressed again and again by the facility with which relative strangers blended voices in such awesome harmony.<p>Susan Briehl is a pastor, preacher, liturgist and essayist. Her words are the counterpoint of Marty Haugen's chords. Between them, Marty and Susan laid out the wealth and breadth of Lutheran tradition: its committed reliance on Scripture, the empowering freedom given to the Priesthood of Believers, the understanding of Sacrament and symbol held in common with all manifestations of the Church catholic. Day by day, my understanding deepened of what it means to sojourn among Lutherans. In subsequent articles I will share details of several workshops, including <i>Reflections on Sabbath</i>; <i>Space, Colour and Shape</i>; and <i>A Common Liturgical Language</i>. <center><p><img src="trinityDivider.JPG" height="48" width="789"> </center><p><br><table border="0" cols="3" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Intro"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote><td><blockquote> <center><a name="Sabbath"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="+2"> Recollections of "Gather Us In"</font></font> <br> <b><i><font size="-1">the 2000 ELCIC National Worship Conference</font></i></b> <br> <font size="+3">Reflections on Sabbath</font> <br> <b>By Pamela Jane Mclean</b></center></blockquote><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Language"><img src="arrowyg.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote></table><p>Church conferences tend to begin in midweek and build toward the Sabbath. But at <b><i>Gather Us In, </i></b>scheduling conflicts -- or perhaps God --&nbsp; intervened. The conference had to be held from Sunday to Wednesday. And so we formed our community with the Sabbath, and moved forward from there. Following Sunday worship, the delegates dispersed to unhurried recreation; returning in the waning afternoon to picnic together on the Augustana grounds. Later, conference delegates gathered to reflect on their Sabbath experience.<p>For most conference delegates, a true Sabbath rest is rare. A high proportion of delegates were clergy and worship leaders, for whom Sunday is their primary day of <i>work.</i> Even laity may find "rest" a rarity -- it helped to be three hundred kilometres from my household's washing-up, ironing and lawn-mowing. Sadly, for some people just attending worship is an obligation that overburdens the Sabbath. In the past, Sabbath-keeping was often made a burden: some older people may remember long joyless Sundays with most pastimes forbidden. Sabbath legalism is unscriptural; we are told that "Man was not made for the Sabbath". Yet in the same passage Scripture tells us that Sabbath <i>was</i> created <i>for</i> man, that it is good for men to keep a day of rest.&nbsp; Keynote presenters Susan Briehl and Marty Haugen asked us to reconsider Sabbath-keeping as a sacred privilege. By choosing to forego our Sabbath rest, we harm ourselves and our communities. By the choices we make regarding how we spend the Sabbath, we enslave our sisters and brothers. Marty and Susan asked us to consider; first, what are the weaknesses that plague our communities; and second, what are the changes we as a community could make in our practice of Sabbath-keeping that might address those weaknesses.<p>The questions clash awkwardly with our prior assumptions. Can Sabbath-keeping address such real problems as lack of vision and decaying neighbourhoods? It would be easy to misconstrue the question as "what are the weaknesses <i>with our present Sabbath-keeping</i>"! That problem was quickly blamed in turn on organizations that schedule children's events on Sunday; on businessmen and women who are too business-focussed to bother with church, or those modern parents who won't be satisfied providing their children with old-fashioned Sunday-School experiences. Such blaming is a mistake: we cannot solve any problem if we assume they are someone else's fault. In the case of Sabbath-keeping, what we needed to do instead was re-examine all our assumptions.<p>Sabbath-keeping does <i>not</i> inherently mean "church attendance". Sabbath was established during the Israelites' wilderness sojourn, whereas communal Sabbath worship was established in the synagogues of the Diaspora hundreds of years later.&nbsp; For clergy and worship leaders, this means that they can with perfect consistency take their sabbath on some other day, most typically Monday. For lay people, this means that there <i>is</i> no "burden" of compulsory attendance at worship. Instead, lay people are freed to ask, "in what way can I remember today to keep holy the Sabbath?" With worship, of course, but worship takes many forms. In worshipping a God who is&nbsp; Perfect Community -- Three in One, we find ourselves yearning to worship as community. Like Sabbath-keeping itself, our presence at worship becomes delightful longed-for privilege instead of obligation.<p>But how can Sabbath-keeping address the real problems that face, for example, the community of Emmanuel? What <i>are</i> Emmanuel's problems? Are there any changes which <i>Emmanuel </i>as a community should make? These are questions for the people of Emmanuel, individually and corporately, to answer for themselves.<p>And as for me and my house, we will confine the weekend's washing-up, lawn-mowing and ironing to Saturday. <center><p><img src="trinityDivider.JPG" height="47" width="789"> </center><table border="0" cols="3" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Intro"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote><td><blockquote> <center><a name="Language"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="+2"> Recollections of "Gather Us In"</font></font> <br> <b><i><font size="-1">the 2000 ELCIC National Worship Conference</font></i></b> <br> <font size="+3">A Common Liturgical Language</font> <br> <b>By Pamela Jane Mclean</b></center></blockquote><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Shape"><img src="arrowyg.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote></table><p>Workshop speaker Susan Briehl had never&nbsp; before been introduced as an artist. How that remission occurred is bemusing, for her love of language flows like poetry in every word of her preaching and liturgy. The first keynote presentation aparently recapitulated Susan's presentation to the ELCA's Jubilee 2000 Conference, the text of which is available at <a href="http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/briehl.html"> http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/briehl.html</a>. In it, Susan enlarged lyrically upon a single sentence:<blockquote>"In our ongoing search for a common liturgical language, let us choose words rooted in the biblical witness, shaped by the prayers of the&nbsp; faithful in every time and place, spacious enough to name the mystery of the holy trinity, expansive enough to embrace all that God would unite, and evocative of lives that anticipate God's future."</blockquote>Why do we even need a common liturgical language? Because God has made us a people of language. Infants begin babbling because the feeling of speach is sensually pleasant. Their babbling praises God: Infants are free from worry as to whether their anthems rhyme or form theological constructs. Our best liturgy is simular: repeated phrases that flow from the heart at a level that transcends analytical thought. Where pentecostal worshippers turn to glossalalia to give utterance to their deepest feelings beyond words, we have access to the timeless beauty of our liturgy. We must put on our children's lips the best that our tradition has to offer: they need no spiritual pablum. The simple beauty of Agnus Dei and Kyrie with their flowing repetetive words are as natural a praise-language for the young child as is babbling for an infant. As we claim the language of our tradition, let us also claim its silence. LBW&nbsp; 441. Silence is the true universal language. It is to our liturgy, what the doctrine of the incarnation is to our theology: a proclaimation that the finite has the ability to bear the infinite.<p>All the beauty of liturgical language that we have inherited from our tradition is firmly rooted in Scripture. As we enlarge upon that language, we must continue to be rooted in Scripture. As Susan said, "were we to choose another book for our source of liturgical language, we would be choosing another religion". The Lutheran tradition holds to a "Living Word" hermeneutic. Lutherans are not by their tradition literalists or fundamentalists, who would confine the power of the Word to text on a printed page. Neither do Lutherans adopt protestant liberal biblical criticism. The Living Word transcends the written text. The text points to the living word. Great images, rich in power as consomme is rich in the flavour of the broth from which it is condensed, reach out from the written word to draw our hearts to the Living Word. Susan recounted to us the Great "O" antiphons: Adonai, Key of David, Root of Jesse, Emmanuel, Wisdom, Ruler of Nations, Dayspring. Each scriptural image evokes the concentrated power of the scriptural narrative that informs it. "We are a people of stories", Susan said. We must tell our stories, so that we know who we are.<p>The two great reformation changes to the mass were, adopting the language of the people, and the introduction of the Hymn of the Day. The loss of the Kyrie, the loss of the Hymn of the Day from our common worship, equates to the loss of the Lutheran Liturgy. Participating in the liturgy is like putting on a cloak made frokm the prayers of the faithful departed. Losing the liturgy is like being robbed. The Hymn of the Day is liturgical recognition that proclaimation is a baptismal ministry. The pastor preaches his sermon to us; it would be easy to accept, at the end of the sermon, that the work of proclaimation has been done for us. Instead in Lutheran tradition, the people stand for the Hymn of the Day and "preach back"; expounding on Scripture through hymnody. According to Susan, liturgy is like a vine: improper husbandry or neglect lets the vine wither, or grow agressively feral. Good liturgy is like wine, in contrast to grape-flavoured Koolaid: but not all wines age well. We are called to a continuing reformation. We must taste and see -- both of the old wine and of the new. The question to ask is not "is this language traditional or contemporary", but "does our language widen God's embrace; does it express honest, authentic human experience; does it point to what is essential". We must both claim, and test, our liturgical heritage.<p>As we discover new liturgical language, we must test it, too. A frequent challenge in discovering language for God is to determine, whether the language we are using is too limited, or whether a wider description is in fact a "different" god. "God" is as far from a concrete noun as can be conceived. Our language can function to hem in God, but God rejects such language. We may refer to God as "Lord", but God declares god's self to be "I AM". The Matthean formula for the Trinity, "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit" is good language, historic and ecumenical, but it is not adequate. Theologians and liturgists have striven throughout the ages to find words to encompass the trinity. Augustine refered to "the Lover, the Beloved, and Love". Luther refered to "the Speaker, the Word, and ?" One modern theologian expresses God is "Rain, Soaring Mist, Perfect Stream". But in our striving, we must be very careful. "Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier", a popular formulation, in fact reflects the modalist heresy of claiming that different "modes" of the Godhead function independantly. Yet even often uninspiring sources may produce felicitous words. Tertullian has given us "Root , Tree and Fruit". John gives us "Vine Dresser, Vine, and the Juice of Life". There is only one fruit: Love -- to be crushed down that it may become wine that intoxicates the world with grace."<p>Words can include or exclude. "Family" language is a common metaphor for the relationships of the worshipping community. It is good language -- but still we must be sensitive. Does the single bachelor, the street teen, or the widower, newly alone, identify with being part of family? Or can even that language be exclusive? Perhaps no&nbsp; language, no metaphor can include everyone -- perhaps our sensitivity to others must lead us to use a wealth of varied language. Our language and our worship practices must be varied enough to name a wider community: we must make space for the people who aren't there. At a church where she previously pastored, Susan proposed removing a pew to make room for a wheelchair. One of her committee objected "but, we don't have anyone at church in a wheelchair. As Susan said, "Well, duh." In my own experience I have worked in churches where adding accomodation for children was similarly greeted with "but we don't *have* any children attending." Well, duh. It is hard to see the people who aren't there. But we must ask ourselves who they are -- and how we can make room for them to come in. Perhaps, it is the mourners who are missing. Perhaps it is the guilty. When the penitential and lamentory elements of our service are omitted in favour of upbeat praise, we find ourselves abandoned in our hour of need -- for we have lost the language that could include our sorrow. In our joy, we sing the songs of sorrow in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who sorrow. In our sorrow, we are upheld by the songs of our brothers and sisters who know joy.<img src="wetpaint.gif" height="167" width="149" align="Texttop"> <center><img src="trinityDivider.JPG" height="48" width="789"> </center><table border="0" cols="3" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Language"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote><td><blockquote> <center><a name="Shape"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="+2"> Recollections of "Gather Us In"</font></font> <br> <b><i><font size="-1">the 2000 ELCIC National Worship Conference</font></i></b> <br> <font size="+3">Space, Colour and Shape: An Eye to the Spirit</font> <br> <b>By Pamela Jane Mclean</b></center></blockquote><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Children"><img src="arrowyg.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote></table><p>Rhonda Harder Epp is an artist living and working in Camrose Alberta. In addition to her professional work, she has taken responsibility for the art decorating her own community's worship space.<p>Christian art is historically grounded in mature classical aesthetic: realism, and idealism. In the first three centuries prior to Constantine, when Christianity was oppressed by the state, Christian art also functioned as covert communications. A highly informed symbology evolved, wherein specific symbols gained highly informed meanings. The most familiar to us is probably the ichthys, a simple picture of a fish that, to a first-century christian was the mnemonic for "Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour". In the same way, a lamb carrying a crook specifies "Lamb of God", three intertwined circles specifies "Father, Son and Holy Spirit". Following the establishment of Christianity by Constantine, Christian art adopted much of the triumphalist aspects of imperial art. Realistic depictions, icons and statuary adopted much of the ostentatious style used to depict emperors and Olympian gods. The Reformation included a strong backlash against this triumphalism, to the extent that the reformation's approach to high art can be seen at best as indifferent,&nbsp; at worst as outright destructive.* The visual impact of this backlash can be seen by contrasting the stained glass saints and biblical scenes in churches of the older artistic tradition, such as Saint Stephen's Anglican church or the Cathedral Church of the Redeemer; with the stained glass Chi-rhos and Trinity-roses of an older Lutheran church such as Saint Matthew's or Sharon. Symbolic representational art speaks strongly to the Lutheran aesthetic. Luther himself combined such symbols in his well-known personal crest: a latin cross (the Church) inside a rose mounted on a heart (The Love of God) surrounded by flames (the Holy Spirit). To the informed mind representational symbols are visual antiphons -- pointing through the image to a specific phrase of scripture, that itself epitomizes a scriptural theme.<p>However, to the seeker or stranger among us, such symbols have no power to speak. In aspiring to appeal visually to a wider community, our art must be informed by more transcendent artistic principles: a deeper psychological understanding of colour, shape and texture. Warm colours are inviting or exciting; cool colours are serene or detached. Complex shapes and textures engage the eye and draw it in; or may distract and confuse. Different textures communicate different feelings. Depictions of everyday objects may draw on associations from our common secular life. The average person may not be able to manipulate these principles to communicate a particular spirit or sense. Artists themselves may be unable to articulate how they are using colour and form, but it is an instinct for these subtler meanings&nbsp; that make an artist. The liturgical artist thrives in an environment of artistic freedom, where she is able to follow that instinct.<p>Modern liturgical art should reflect the rhythms of the worshipping community, a significant component of which is the liturgical year. Such art is often ephemeral, and therefore correspondingly inexpensive. Text and heavy symbolism is unnecessary. Rather, liturgical art may simply provide a pleasant resting place for the eye, freeing the mind to focus on the Word. When three-dimensional and mobile art are admitted, the whole worship space becomes available to the artist. Paper dolls can be used to frame an advent wreath, or cut giant-size to stand in a frozen dance before the altar. A cut-out flock of sheep before the altar might illustrate pastoral themes, or tissue-paper flames might cascade from the ceiling in a bold pentecost mobile. Flexible art might be assembled in different shapes from week to week, to continue to engage observers in defiance of familiarity.<img src="wetpaint.gif" height="167" width="149" align="Texttop"><p><font size="-2">*The Presbyterian destruction of the Neville tombs springs to the mind of this descendent of Jacobite exiles.</font> <center><img src="trinityDivider.JPG" height="48" width="789"> </center><table border="0" cols="3" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Shape"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote><td><blockquote> <center><a name="Children"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="+2"> Recollections of "Gather Us In"</font></font> <br> <b><i><font size="-1">the 2000 ELCIC National Worship Conference</font></i></b> <br> <font size="+3">Welcoming Children to Worship</font> <br> <b>By Pamela Jane Mclean</b></center></blockquote><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Ten"><img src="arrowyg.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote></table><p>As adults, we already know how to appeal to children.

It was an all engaging experience. This one workshop, in particular, cannot even vaguely be summarized in written words. It was a series of "theatre games" meant to create community and engage individuals in the work of a dramatic team; taken from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078470919X/o/qid=968635890/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_3/002-8859091-6544010"> Act it Out! Twenty Terrific Techniques for Teaching Any Bible Story</a> by presenter was Dr. Randy L. Ritz (Big Story Arts and Education; 877-449-1786 toll-free).<ul><li> <font size="+1">TV Personality</font> <br> Students act out the same Bible character on a TV show simultaneously and should all speak at one time. Each student must face the camera (which is the leader). As the leader calls out a character connected to the story, the whole class together must instantly try to tell their story, in character, to the Camera. The leader calls freeze after about 45 seconds and suggests the next character.<li> <font size="+1">Two-Person Drama</font> <br> Divide the group into pairs to illustrate an encounter between two Biblical antagonists. The initiator of the challenge takes three steps away from his or her partner. With eyes closed, all listen to the leader recounting the story of the conflict between the characters. The participants concentrate on what arguments or strategies they can use against their opponent. Then they role-play the conflict.<li> <font size="+1">Blind walk</font> <br> Divide the class into pairs (everyone has a partner). Give a blindfold to each pair. One student will be sighted, the other will be blind. Ask them to ove slowly aroun d the room negotiating objects on floor and tactilely exploring the room. After a few minutes have the partners switch.<li> <font size="+1"> Mirrors</font> <br> Divid into pairs and sit facing each other. One student is the leader and the other is the mirror. The mirror, watching the leaders eyes only -- not the hands, mimics the movements of the leader exactly and at the same time.<li> <font size="+1">See It, Be It</font> <br> Leader asks students/actors to close eyes and silently picture a bible Character. What does he/she look like? Clothes, face, footwear, what are they carrying? Ask questions about what surrounds this person. Do they see and hear the trees, weather, running water, wind. animals, buildings, et cetera. Leader asks the students (with eyes closed) to take the shape of this person. When you open your eyes you be that character -- you will move and do activities as that character. Ignore the others unless you want interaction.<li> <font size="+1"> What's the Story</font> <br> A volunteer is presented with a card that identifies the story. At the front of the of the room the student mimes one of the actions from the story.&nbsp;<br> After 45 seconds, anyone who thinks that they know the story can join in and begin acting at the front of the room. Those joining the acting must do complementary but different actions than any other actor.<li> <font size="+1"> Statues</font> <br> Group is split into pairs; one student is the clay and the other is the sculptor. All of the sculptors explore by shaping the arms, legs, body position and facial expressions of the "human clay" partner. After a 20-second break sculptors then create a "masterpiece" statue of one of the Bible characters in a moment of crisis or discovery. Sculptors examine each other's work. Reverse roles and repeat.<li> <font size="+1">Echo Storytelling</font> <br> The group stands in a circle so that all students can see the leader. The leader tells the story phrase by phrase. Each phrase spoken can have a simple movement and sound if desired, that fits with the words. Students/actors, as one voice, repeat or echo the teacher's phrase including the movement and sound.<li> <font size="+1">Mystery box</font> <br> Sit in a circle. Explain that everyone has an imaginary myster box in front of him or her. Demonstrate by miming the size and shape of the box. One person att a time takes the box, opens the lid and slowly pulls an imaginary oject from the mystery box. Observers determine what the objefct is by how the person handles the object -- its weight, movemmetn, size, et cetera..<li> <font size="+1">Machines</font> <br> Foirm one large circle with everyone seated. Present the theme to the group. They are to find a character, a repetitive action, a sound or word phrase based on that theme.

The speaker for this event was witty and humorous. But sandwiched between western-style comedy lyrics (the only excuse, some would claim, for western music) and stand-up comedy, he presented a sensitive insight into the challenge, and struggle, of cradle Lutherans to grow from an essentially ethnic church, into a relevant mainstream denomination with broad appeal, while preserving the historic strengths of their Tradition and culture. One of the dearest such strengths, of course, is the Lutheran tradition of music: "...music," the speaker said "that I remember as being always in four-part harmony".<img src="backhammer.gif" height="72" width="72" align="Texttop"> <center><img src="trinityDivider.JPG" height="48" width="789"> </center><table border="0" cols="3" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Fellowship"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote><td><blockquote> <center><a name="Life"></a><font color="#666666"><font size="+2"> Recollections of "Gather Us In"</font></font><a name="End"></a> <br> <b><i><font size="-1"> the 2000 ELCIC National Worship Conference</font></i></b> <br> <font size="+3"> Beneath the Tree of Life</font> <br> <b><font size="-1"> By Pamela Jane Mclean</font></b></center></blockquote><td width="120"><blockquote><a href="#Intro"><img src="arrowyg.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="Center"> </a></blockquote></table>On the final morning of <i>Gather Us In</i>, conference delegates assembled beneath a spreading tree outside the chapel at Augustana college.

In many ways we were a Sabbath community: we had stepped outside of the business of our daily lives and time stopped for us. We occupied an island of spiritual time, while secular time washed past us in the world outside. Now, having been gathered in, we were sent back out into the world. Susan cautioned us, the world would be changed, because we ourselves had changed.

Shari-Mary loved bright colours. She was a friend to all the brightly coloured things in her kingdom, and she wore their colours in her clothes. Her shoes were as red as the roses, her stockings were as orange as the rocks on the road, her skirt was a yellow as the sunshine, her sash was as green as the grass, her blouse was as blue as the sky, and her crown was of purple amethysts like the mountains at the edge of her kingdom.</font></h4><h4><br></h4><h4><font size="+1">Every morning when she woke up, Shari-Mary said good-morning to the bright yellow sunbeam that shone into her room. But one morning, the sunbeam wasn't bright and yellow. It was pale and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Sunbeam!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright yellow colour?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the sunbeam. "Well, why don't you chase him and get it back?" said Princess Shari-Mary.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"I can't chase him," said the sunbeam. "I'm just a little sunbeam. I don't have feet to run after him or hands to catch him."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was bigger than a sunbeam, and she did have hands and feet. So she said bravely, "Don't worry little sunbeam. I'll chase the Black Bogle and get your colour back. And in the mean time," she said, sighing a little, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the little sunbeam soaked up all the bright yellow from Princess Shari-Mary's skirt, until her skirt was dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went to the window and looked out, to see if she could tell where the Black Bogle had gone. The sky overhead was pale and gray. Princess Shari-Mary gasped in amazement.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Sky!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright blue colour?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the sky.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Well, why don't you chase him and get it back? You're not too little. You cover the whole world" said Princess Shari-Mary.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"I cover the whole world," said the sky, "but I'm made of nothing. I can't chase him."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she wasn't made of nothing. So she said bravely, "Don't worry, sky. I'll chase the Black Bogle and get your colour back. And in the mean time," she said, sighing a little, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the sky soaked up all the bright blue from Princess Shari-Mary's blouse, until her blouse was dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went from the palace. The palace garden was covered with soft green grass. But today, the grass wasn't bright and green. It was pale and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Grass!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright green colour?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the blades of grass.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Oh, you poor little things," said Princess Shari-Mary. "And you can't chase him, can you, because you're rooted to the soil.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"That's right," said the blades of grass sadly.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was bigger than the blades of grass. So she said, "Don't worry, little blades of grass. I'll chase the Black Bogle and get your colour back from the Black Bogle. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the little blades of grass soaked up all the bright green from Princess Shari-Mary's sash, until her sash was dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went past the rose-hedge that bordered the palace garden. The roses weren't their usual bright red. They were pale and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Roses!" said Shari-Mary. "Did that Black Bogle steal your bright red colour, too?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the roses sadly.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was bigger and stronger than a rose. So she said bravely, "Don't worry little roses. I'm going to catch that Black Bogle and get back the yellow for the sunbeam and the blue for the sky and the green for the grass, and I'll get back your colour too. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the little roses soaked up all the bright red from Princess Shari-Mary's shoes, until her shoes were dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary carried on to the road that led away from the palace. The stones of the road, which were usually orange, were dull gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Stones!" said Shari-Mary. "Did the Black Bogle come this way and steal your colour?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the stones. "He ran away toward the mountains."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Don't worry," said Princess Shari-Mary. "I'm going to catch that Black Bogle and get back the yellow for the sunbeam and the blue for the sky and the green for the grass and the red for the roses, and I'll get back your colour too. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the little stones of the road soaked up all the bright orange from Princess Shari-Mary's stockings, until her stockings were dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Now Shari-Mary was dressed all in gray with only her crown bright purple.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary carried on toward the purple mountains at the edge of her kingdom. But today, the mountains weren't purple. They were just plain gray.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Mountains!" said Shari-Mary. "Did the Black Bogle come this way?"</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the mountains. "He stole our purple colour. Now he's hiding in his cave at the top of the mountains."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">"Well, I'm going straight to that cave to get back all the colours he has stolen," said Princess Shari-Mary. "And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">So the mountains soaked up all the bright purple from Princess Shari-Mary's crown, until it was dull and gray.</font></h4><h4><br></h4><h4><font size="+1">Shari-Mary climbed up into the mountains. Her clothes were all dull and gray, so no-one noticed her climbing up the slopes, not even the Black Bogle. He was fast asleep in the back of his cave.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary tip-toed into the Black Bogle's Caves. Sitting in the middle of the Black Bogle's dining table was a beautiful magic crystal, full of all the colours he had stolen. Princess Shari-Mary picked up the crystal and started back out of the cave.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Just then, the Black Bogle woke up. "WHO IS THAT IN MY CAVE!" he bellowed.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary was so frightened that she dropped the magic crystal. It shattered into a million sparkling bits, and the colours all spilled out. They poured down the mountain-side in a beautiful rainbow, ending right in the middle of the palace garden. Shari-Mary jumped onto the rainbow and slid down it to get away from the Black Bogle. The colours flowed out of the rainbow into all the things whose colours had been stolen, and rubbed off the rainbow onto Shari-Mary's clothes. So once again, Princess Shari-Mary's kingdom was full of brightly coloured things, and Shari-Mary wore their colours on her clothes.</font></h4><h4><font size="+1">And as for the Black Bogle, he roared "HARRUMPH!" and stomped back into his cave. </font></h4><center><p><font size="-1"><a href="denizens.html#pamela">Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center><p><li><h2><a href="/godskids/">Godskids</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=windows-1252" http-equiv="CONTENT-TYPE"><title>godskids</title><meta content="OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 (Win32)" name="GENERATOR"><meta content="Pamela Mclean" name="AUTHOR"><meta content="20031205;1220243" name="CREATED"><meta content="16010101;0" name="CHANGED"><style> <!-- TD P { color: #ffff80 } P { color: #ffff80 } DD { color: #ffff80 } DT { color: #ffff80 } A:link { color: #ff80c0 } A:visited { color: #c0c0c0 } --></style><body dir="ltr" background="pd.jpg" bgcolor="#ff8000" vlink="#c0c0c0" link="#ff80c0" text="#ffff80" lang="en-US"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><br><font size="5"><font color="#993399"></font></font><a href="http://www.logrus.ca/RenegadeMamas.html"><b><font size="7">Are Children Welcome at Worship?</font></b></a> <br><b><font size="4">A summary of children's worship practices in Anglican, Lutheran and other churches in Calgary, Alberta Canada.<br> </font></b><dl><dd style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"><small><small><i><font size="6"><small><small><font color="#ffff00">Background:</font></small></small></font></i> </small></small><dd style="margin-bottom: 0.2in; text-align: left;"> <font size="4">I contacted, visited, or met with parishioners from, each of the churches on the following list. The contacts took place, for the most part, in 1997/1998. I was looking for a church home for my family, but as the list was compiled, I decided to publish it on the Internet for three reasons:<br> </font></dl><ol><ol><li><font size="4">At that time, there was no central Internet listing where one could find the service times and contact information for every Anglican church in Calgary. Many churches simply didn't see the Internet as a relevant resource. I saw it as an obvious (and essentially cost-free) means of reaching out. Thus, I included that information for anyone who hit this page with that concern as their search criteria. A more authoritative resource which has since been established is <a href="http://www.calgary.anglican.ca/Parishes/parish-index.html.">http://www.calgary.anglican.ca/Parishes/parish-index.html.</a> (which you may wish to visit instead of this if that's what you're really looking for)<br> </font><li><font size="4">In my visits or meetings I sought out other mothers of young children in order to get first-hand opinions from the people most affected by attitudes toward children. Many of them told me they were engaged in a similar search for a church home that truly met their needs. But, since such a search is punishingly difficult for those who are already struggling to raise spiritually health children while lacking spiritual nurture themselves, many were settling for unsatisfactory situations on the margin of acceptance in their existing congregations. I wanted to let them and other mothers like them, know what I was finding out. If indeed they were settling for the best that was practically available to them, this research could help them accept that situation. If there was a better situation for them, this research might help them find it. <br> </font><li><font size="4">In some respects, the Internet looks a lot like the chapel door of Wittenberg Castle. Just as in the sixteenth century a subject for public discussion would routinely be posted on the church door, in the twenty-first century a subject is posted on the internet.&nbsp; Although the notion of intergenerational worship and mutual acceptance including children is not new, and the unhappy mothers I was talking to were not invisible, churches simply weren't engaging the issue. After I posted these pages (and they were linked for a week by <a href="www.anglicans_online.org">Anglicans Online</a>) I received email from people around the world, encouraging me or challenging me, letting me know of different ways that individual churches do embrace children or of programmes and consulting services available to churches to improve their inclusivity. I've received advice from Anglican priests from New Zealand to Massachussets to the Arctic; I've heard from people who have added my essays to their Children's Ministry resources and who have implemented ideas that I've proposed here. I've also heard from two Calgary priests who wanted to challenge what I'd said about their churches -- but who hadn't read any of the website. From those discussions I know that the issues did enter into word-of-mouth discussions within the diocese, too. I suspect the result of those discussions shows in those local parish websites that now describe themselves as child-friendly on their home-pages. The question remains as to what has changed beyond their websites. Since a main point of posting these listings was to generate discussion, I've put my email address in a number of places. Please use it if you want to discuss with me!

Where I have since revisited or discussed the church with parishioners I have updated the information. However, in those intervening six years there has been some discussion of children's inclusion. I've added a number of parish websites to the list below, and if you review them you may note that many sites explicitely state that they are child-welcoming and that Nursery/Sunday School are optional.

color="#000099"><font size="+1">On Easter Sunday 1997 I was asked, for the second week in a row, to remove my children from worship. Although not as silent as little adults, the children were not behaving badly. The request came from a parishioner who had, at the baptisms of those same children many months before, promised to do all in her power to support them in their life in Christ. How little we mean the promises we make to our God!</font></font></i></b> <br> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The following week, I began a search for an Anglican church community in Calgary, Alberta; where more than lip service was given to the value of children's ministry. Discouraged by the results, I expanded the search to include Lutheran, then Roman Catholic and other congregations. Subsequently, I was able to address my church's Corporation (that is, Priest and Wardens), on the subject of our ministry with children. <a href="#theIssue">My notes</a> for that event are further down this page.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"><a href="godskids.html">"Are children welcome at Worship"</a> presents the results of my search. Churches are listed from most child-friendly Worship to least child-friendly Worship; I didn't consider any other characteristics. I couldn't visit every church I contacted, so many of the results had to be inferred from the answers and attitudes of the ministers, receptionists and volunteers who answered the phone. In other cases, I talked to church members or visited the church for worship.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">If you know more about any of the churches on this list or have a different impression of them, or if you have an assessment of another church in Calgary that you would like added to this list, I'll be happy to receive your e-mail at <i><a href="mailto:pamela@logrus.ca"> pamela@logrus.com</a></i>.

I liked <a href="http://www.new-ostrog.org/question3.html"> what Archbishop Lazar had to say</a>&nbsp; about their squirming. With older children, by far the most common practice is partial exclusion. This can be seen as "welcome" only in contrast to total exclusion, but many churches that practice partial exclusion, are honestly striving to welcome children. (It's trivial, but I do wonder why some churches advise letting children stand on the pew and others like<a href="http://www.us.net/edov/8/stalbans/tips.htm"> </a></font></font><a href="http://www.us.net/edov/8/stalbans/tips.htm"><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">St. Alban's Episcopal Church Annandale</font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> absolutely forbid it.)</font></font></blockquote><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> "Children's church" is another choice among churches that are not prepared to integrate children completely. Its effectiveness depends greatly on the sincerity of its planners -- it should never be a euphemism for childcare. Similarly&nbsp; religious instruction like <a href="http://www.catechesisgoodshepherd.org/"> "The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd"</a>-- scheduled outside of worship time -- may have value if it is based on respect for the children and sound pedagogy.&nbsp;</font></font></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.famucon.com/html/columns.html"> Families Under Construction: Columns</a> by Carolyn Waterbury-Tieman presents wide-ranging opinions on Children's place.&nbsp;</font></font></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">"Catholic Family Perspectives" also encourages families to worship together.

The Service of Holy Communion comprises all five elements of Gathering the community, Ministry of the Word, Prayer, Celebration of the Eucharist, and the Dismissal; all of which are essential elements of the service. This worship is the defining act of the community, such that the congregation is often referred to as the "Eucharistic Community". It is the right and duty of every baptized person to take his or her part in the Divine Service: this is the clear guidance of scripture, of the primitive church, and of the Rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services.&nbsp;</font></font> <br> <font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1"> *</font></font> <br> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> Worship is NOT Sunday School, Junior Church, or any other structure where persons are physically or spiritually segregated from the Eucharistic Community.

These activities have great value if children are not regularly welcome at Worship; but their mere existence implies that the church dose not meet the standard of having children visibly present, involved and accomodated at the whole of the principal weekly worship.&nbsp;</font></font></table><table border="1" width="90%"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff"><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">What is the issue behind Children in Worship?</font></font></b><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> We are addressing an issue of vital importance. Before we talk about new Sunday-school curricula or crying rooms, let us be clear what the issue is.</font></font></ul><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is not an issue of whether Saint N- will survive into the 21st century. Without children, it will not; but that is irrelevant if the light of the Spirit here has already been quenched.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is not an issue of whether X- was right or wrong in ordering me out of Church with Rachel, or of how much I was hurt. X-'s overt attack was an aberration, far more hurtful to herself than to me. At that instant I was wrapped in God's grace; I am not in need of personal healing.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is not an issue of Anne's and Rachel's spiritual well-being, or of H-'s and J-'s, or of A-'s and C-'s, or D-'s, G-'s and R-'s. These children have devout Christian parents who will ensure their children are fed, even if it is not at Saint N-'s table. On the day of judgement, God will not care whether these children experienced Christ among Lutherans, among Pentecostals or among Anglicans.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is not at its core an issue of Children's Ministry, ineffective though ours is. When a programme becomes ineffective, we simply re-examine our goals and come up with a new way to meet them.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> There is the issue! What are our goals and how do we examine them?&nbsp;</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> Our goal must be to do God's Will, as discerned through prayer and study of Holy Scripture. Any other goal, any other standard, severs us from the Vine. Did you hear the Gospel last Sunday? Did you write the words upon your Spirit that you might speak them with your mouth and dwell on them in your heart? "Whoever does not remain in me is thrown out like a branch and dries up. <i>John 15v6</i>" What I am bringing before Corporation and Vestry is an urgent spiritual concern arising from our joint baptismal calling and supported unequivocably by Scripture. If you accept God's Will as our goal and Scripture as our standard, you will hear its urgency. If you do not, you will stand with the priests of Ancient Israel, whom God calls to account for their scattered flock. <i>Jer 23v1</i></font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is an issue of Salvation. Not of the children I named, who are safe in God's care. But what of 1-year-old M- and 3-year-old G-, whom I met in a playground? Their mother told me "I wish I could take them to church, but someone would probably march down the aisle and throw us out." Or A- and R-, whose mother said "I tried going to church, but they expected me to stay in the lobby the whole time, and I thought, 'what's the point?'" We cannot excuse ourselves by saying, "well, we have a Sunday School and a nursury for the children." These mothers want to take their children to church, not to a nursury. As more than one mother has said, "I work five days a week; when I'm not working I want him with me." And toddlers and babies want to be with their parents, too: nursuries do not work for under-two's. "Jesus saw the crowds, and his heart was filled with pity for them, because they were harassed and distressed, like sheep without a shepherd. So he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is large, but there are few workers to gather it in. Pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in the harvest.' <i>Matthew 9v36-38</i>" To see "harassed and distressed", stand outside a daycare at 5:00 pm.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is an issue of Salvation for D- and her three children. Perhaps we don't have to change our ways for the sake of G-'s and A-'s mothers; we can tell ourselves, they aren't Anglicans and if they really wanted to go to church they'd find one somewhere. But D- was one of our "A-list" members. When she stopped attending after her eldest was born I thought judgementally, "why is it too hard to get the children to church when you manage to get them to trivialities like swimming lessons and playschool?" What I learned during Anne's toddler years is that it's not the getting here that's too hard, it's being here in the face of expressed disapproval. Many mothers just give up on church. D- told me she would be back when her children were older. They are, but she's not.</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> This is an issue of Salvation for every adult in the congregation. Jesus said "If anyone causes one of these little ones to fall away, it were better for him if a millstone were tied around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. <i>Matthew 18v6</i>" Children learn what they live. If they live the experience of being set apart from the Body Sunday after Sunday, they will learn to set themselves apart. Look around you! We, by our Sunday-School practices, have caused the greater part of two generations to fall away from their Lord. It hurts for a devout believer to look at her grown children and know that the sum of their commitment is the occasional Christmas service. She can shield herself by saying, "oh, well, it's not important; at least they're good people." But it is important. To say otherwise denies our baptismal covenant. God is giving us another chance in these other children. Let's stop repeating our obvious mistakes.</font></font><p><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> Reply to the argument, that Anglican worship is characterised by good order and discipline, and that children must therefor be still and silent:</font></font></b><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> Being Anglican is a distinct way of being Christian. It is defined by our Book of Common Prayer, which is the witness to our Tradition. If we need more guidance than Scripture, let us look first to that witness. The clear teaching of our Prayer Book is that the Church is the whole company of Christ's Catholic people militant here on earth. That's the whole company: all ages, all colours, all abilities, all social classes, and people who sing out of tune.&nbsp;</font></font><p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> The Prayer Book provides two additional concrete instructions, on how to accomodate children. On page 530 it instructs Parents and Sponsors of a baptised child to "teach him to pray, and bring him to take his part in public worship." On page 544, it instructs the Pastor of every Parish to instruct and examine the children of his Parish after the Second Lesson at Morning or Evening Prayer.</font></font></ul><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Reply to the argument, that the grieving, the hard-of-hearing, and those with migraine headaches need Church to be silent:</font></font></b><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> You can find God, quiet, and solace on a mountain peak or in your prayer closet; or prayerful music on CD or in live performance at the Philharmonic; but you can't be 'at' Church unless the Church is allowed to gather. If a person 'needs' church for healing or empowerment, they 'need' the children and other disempowered members to be there being the Church. A club where some are welcome and some excluded is not the Church</font></font></ul><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Reply to the argument, that it is only badly-behaved children who are unwelcome:</font></font></b><ul> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"> Vestry has considered publishing a standard for behaviour upon which welcome would be contingent. Another word for 'contingent' is 'conditional, and a conditional welcome has the same value as conditional love: none whatsoever. Behaviour standards, however reasonable, will be perceived by Christ's "harrassed and distressed" flock as a foundation for judgementalism, and we will be barring our doors to those over-sensitive parents as effectively as if the warden stood across the opening to turn them away. Parents are incredibly sensitive to unintended criticism. One parent told me "Sometimes someone will say, "you know we have a nursery don't you? You know what they mean, and you just don't come back." Another told me, "I always think that if there is a crying room, you're expected to be in it." Another was mortified and left because a priest said "feel free to walk around if it will help (comfort your crying baby)". Another said "they say children are welcome, but they always add 'of course, if he get's really bad, you'll want to take him out.' Then you know you're going to have to live up to their standard of what is 'really bad'". In my search, I came across two churches, both Lutheran, who were particularly kind to paranoid parents. Foothill's Lutheran staff never mention their excellent crying room without adding "but we hope parents will try to cope in the pew first." And the staff at Emmanuel Lutheran added, "Of course, if he gets really upset,...it'll still be up to you."</font></font></ul></ul></table></ul><a name="theIssue"></a><ul><ul> <center><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html#pamela"> Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font></center></ul></ul><li><h2><a href="/Parenting-blankets/">Parenting Blankets</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><meta content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" http-equiv="Content-Type"><meta content="Pamela Jane Mclean" name="Author"><meta content="Mozilla/4.05 [en] (WinNT; U) [Netscape]" name="GENERATOR"><meta content="Baby activity blankets on scripturaly themes are an appropriate liturgical aid for the smallest members of the Christian community." name="Description"><title>Parenting -Ideas and Insights - Baby Blankets</title><body background="pd.jpg" alink="#ffffff" vlink="#ffff80" link="#ff00ff" bgcolor="#008080" text="#ffff00"><h1><font color="#993399"><small><small><b><font size="+4"><small><small> This is just a shadow of the Logrus.

Goals are hard to discern, and its easy to assume that another's goals must be the same as your own, because your own are so obviously right. Even agreeing on a goal such as "to be good wives and mothers" may not be enough. For one person, that may mean "to be accepted in the best social circles and keep a spotless house", to another it might mean "to share my husbands interests and offer my children a range of experiences." The apparently-like goals may be fundamentally contradictory.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1"><b>Mentors must themselves be successful. </b>What a mentor brings to the mentoring relationship is her experience. A protege accepts that experience because it will help her succeed. So, a woman who is trying to be a godly wife will have no desire to follow in the footsteps of one whose husband does not call her blessed.

Why <b><i>should </i></b>they become our enemies?</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Actually, there are some good reasons for teenage conflict. The primary one is, that there is no such life-stage as "teenage". No-one is happy to be forced into a role that doesn't exist. In traditional cultures one makes the transition directly from the well-defined world of childhood, directly to the equally well-defined world of adulthood. When a Jewish boy on his thirteenth birthday says, "today I am a man", he means it. All at once, his parents lose the right to obedience, and become mere advisors who, having had their say, must let their son make his own choices -- and let him live with the consequences. Our culture "invented" teenagerhood, because our adults are unwilling to let our children have their own responsibilities.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The argument is made that at thirteen, or even nineteen, a person is not ready to take on adult responsibilities: you certainly wouldn't expect them to pay room and board. Wrong! At nineteen, or even thirteen, a person who does not choose to accept your advice cannot be forced to accept it. Sixty years ago he might have run away to the frontier or the army, today he can run to the streets. <i>And you will lose him</i> . You had better make sure all the groundwork for your child's character is complete by the time he is twelve, because that is the only chance you will get! And, if the groundwork is complete, we can trust our young-adult children to continue the building themselves.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">We have only twelve years to give a child all the "upbringing" that he will get. If that inflicts a terrible sense of urgency upon the parents of infants and toddlers, so much the better. Let us pour our energies today, into giving our children the best spiritual training we can; and at the same time let us train up our own hearts in courage so that at the right moment, we can let them go.</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;</ul></table></center> <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font> <br> <b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></b> <br> &nbsp; <center><dd> <font size="-1">Back to <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html">Denizens of the Logrus</a></font> </center> &nbsp;<li><h2><a href="/RenegadeMamas/">Renegademamas</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"><html><head><meta http-equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"><title>Saint Stephens Anglican (Calgary AB CA)</title><meta name="GENERATOR" content="OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 (Win32)"><meta name="AUTHOR" content="Pamela Jane Mclean"><meta name="CREATED" content="20031205;1221723"><meta name="CHANGED" content="16010101;0"><style> <!-- TD P { color: #ffff80 } P { color: #ffff80 } DT { color: #ffff80 } A:visited { color: #8000ff } --></style><body lang="en-US" text="#ffff80" vlink="#8000ff" bgcolor="#008080" background="pd.jpg" dir="ltr"><dl><dt style="text-align: center;"><font size="5"><font color="#993399"></font></font><br><dt style="text-align: center;"><a href="Parenting-control.html"><font color="#8000ff"><img src="arrowyg.gif" name="Graphic1" align="middle" width="236" height="84" border="1"></font></a><a href="Parenting-control.html"> </a></dl><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#ffa4a8"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffced0"><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a name="whatWelcome"></a> <font color="#000000"><font size="5">What do I mean by asking if children are "Welcome at Worship"?</font></font><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><b>By <i>Worship</i>, I mean the principal weekly worship of the Christian community, which by Tradition is the Service of Holy Communion and takes place on Sunday. The Service of Holy Communion comprises all five elements of Gathering the community, Ministry of the Word, Prayer, Celebration of the Eucharist, and the Dismissal; all of which are essential elements of the service. This worship is the defining act of the community, such that the congregation is often referred to as the "Eucharistic Community". It is the right and duty of every baptized person to take his or her part in the Divine Service: this is the clear guidance of scripture, of the primitive church, and of the Rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services.&nbsp;</b></font><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><b><i>Worship </i>is NOT Sunday School, Junior Church, or any other structure where persons are physically or spiritually segregated from the Eucharistic Community. While some kind of Sunday School is valuable, it is distinct from Worship and is not part of the question being asked.&nbsp;</b></font><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><b><i>Worship </i>is NOT participation in one or two elements of the service and exclusion from the rest.</b></font><p align="center"><font color="#000000"><b>By <i>Welcome</i>, I mean <i>visibly </i>present, <i>involved as participants </i>in the work of the laity, and <i>accomodated </i>by such adaptations to the physical and intellectual structures of the worship and worship-space as are necessitated by their physical, intellectual, and emotional nature. <i>Welcome </i>does not include grudging or conditional tolerance, "separate but equal" services where the children participate and the adults do not, or special-guest appearances on "Intergenerational Sundays". These activities have great value if children are <font size="4">not </font>regularly welcome at Worship; but their mere existence implies that the church does not meet the standard of having children visibly present, involved and accomodated at the whole of the principal weekly worship.&nbsp;</b></font></table><dl><dt style="text-align: center;"><b><font color="#808080">x</font></b></dl><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#ffa4a8"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffced0"><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><font size="5">A Vision of the Church</font></font><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><font size="4">The church is the whole company of Christ's people on earth. Although God in God's infinite power can save anyone - without external rites like Baptism and without external behaviours like church-going; once someone has begun a new life in Christ, that life will be lived in the context of the church. It will be a life "in the world", so it will be marked by service and witness to others; but it will also be a life "not of the world", so it will be marked by prayer and bible-study, and by participation in the Eucharistic community. These ideas about the Christian life are not some flakey personal agenda; they are intrinsic to the BAS Baptism liturgy, in which the priest asks, "Will you continue in the Apostle's teaching and fellowship, the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers?" My vision of the church is of a Community where the whole company of Christ's people participate as equals in prayer, study, and Eucharistic worship.&nbsp;</font></font><p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><b>The Whole Company of Christ's People</b></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Our culture normally divides people up by age, sex, and social class. That is the way of the world. The way of the Kingdom must be different: for how can we divide the Body of Christ? The metaphor of the "Body" teaches us that we are differentiated by the different work to which we are called and for which we are equipped. My vision of a congregation is of a Chancel Guild including men and young people, Quilters likewise, Vestry and Corporation that include women, the elderly, and the poor, and similarly outreach workers, fund-raisers, various committees and work-groups; all without the exclusion implicit in an "ACW", "Mother's Union", "Young People's", "College and Career" and "Men's Fellowship". I envision people drawn together by common work and interests; not separated by external differences.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Our tradition tells us that by Baptism we become full members in the church; and that children of Christian homes not only may, but should be brought to be baptised. So children will be included in any group for which the Spirit equips them. Furthermore, since we believe our work to be important and know that others must carry it on after us, we will make room in our Christian work for children who are not yet equipped so they may learn it in the same natural way that they learn to talk, and we will let them share in the simple tasks that are within their scope. Similarly, since our faith teaches us that a person's value is independent of his productivity, we will include in our groups disabled persons without begrudging that they may work differently. And of course, since scripture gives elders the responsibility of instructing younger members, our groups will include the elderly, finding creative ways to involve even shut-ins in their work. And because we do not judge among ourselves, working-class and welfare recipients, immigrants and refugees, the divorced and members of non-traditional households, will be <b><i>and feel</i></b> as welcome as married white anglo-saxon socialites.</font></font>&nbsp;<p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><b>The Whole People at prayer</b></font></font><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Everyone will&nbsp; know someone who could bring their needs to a prayer-group or prayer-chain, and every important ministry will receive on-going prayer support. Children would be taught and encouraged to be part of communal prayer - certainly their prayers are every bit "as good" as anyone else's.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><b>The Whole People at Study</b></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The Body will suppport many study groups, offering different styles of learning appropriate to the different learning styles of the people, so that every commited member of the Community is actively involved in long-term systematic growth in their understanding and application of their faith. Some styles of learning will be inapplicable to some persons - few if any toddlers would attend a seminar-style study group. But the differentiation will be a matter of choice, not exclusion. Importantly, some study styles will be available that do include everyone, and most styles would be available to most members. Equally important, study opportunities will be planned so as NOT to conflict with our duty to be present at divine Worship or with our duty to earn our living.&nbsp;</font></font> &nbsp;<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font size="4"><b>The Whole People at Worship</b></font></font><p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">We say that Baptism makes us full members of the church. The Bible, traditional wisdom, and child psychology all tell us that children learn what they live. We have demographic studies that show that the most effective Christian conformation of children takes place when they are naturally accepted in the worshipping community and learn to worship as they learn to talk - by doing it regularly with beloved adults and siblings. We also know that for adults marriages are stronger, psyche's more healthy, stress less damaging and weakness mitigated, when worship is a regular experience. The Biblical norm for intentional community worship is weekly on the Sabbath, but we also know from demographic studies that a large segment of the Community attends approximately monthly; and some alternate between two Communities.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">My vision is of a Community whose worship-space is made comfortable for everyone who has lost, or has not yet gained, the bodily control to sit for extended periods on hard non-ergonomic pews; by providing physical and psychological space appropriate to their needs. Soft, unbarriered space should be available where children can see all the action of the liturgy; for example a big carpet on the floor in front of the pews.</font></font>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">It will of course be the norm for children and youths to be present for the whole worship, since that is our expectation of any full baptised members of the Church of God. Children should be free to move, sitting with different adults (possibly for only a short time) or "claiming" the worship-space by bodily exploring it. As they grow, they can appropriately be taught to focus on the liturgy by patient, gentle instruction; without losing their sense of familiar belonging. Parents worried about bothering others would be told by church staff and congregation alike, "we have space in the Narthex where you can still hear, if you need to remove him, but we do hope you'll try to cope in the Church"; When parents <b>do </b>remove a fussy child, other members will follow them out and encourage them to bring the child back as soon as possible: or help them find diapers, crackers, or other necessities of coping. Members would tolerate the occasional fuss, since children must NOT learn that church is where they can be undisciplined; nor must they learn that their out-of-control feelings make them unacceptable in the Community.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">Worship resources will be available to engage babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers as well as school children. This would include baby activity blankets with scriptural themes and Christian symbols; soft toddler toys such as liturgically-dressed ragdolls, cloth Noah's-Ark or Garden-of-Eden toys, and soft Bible-books; and vivid illustrations of the readings in banner or flannelgraph form.</font></font> &nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">The worship should use accessible, familiar forms of music, liturgical language, and scripture. Hymns would use simple or repetetive words and music (Trisagion and Agnus Dei are a good models), and will be chosen from a relatively small (but evolving) repertoire.&nbsp;</font></font>&nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">A consistent service will be used week after week in a&nbsp; form which&nbsp; helps the Whole People focus on the liturgy. The most accessible translation of the Scripture should be read in the service. At present this is the CEV. More poetic versions are appropriate during Bible Studies, since the unfamiliar words can be researched and explained; but when heard cold during a service a simple version is more accessible even to biblically literate adults. The importance of making the Word accessible during our one defining Community activity cannot be overstated.</font></font> &nbsp;<p><font size="4"><font color="#000000">All members of the Community will contribute to the worship as they are called and gifted. Worship will include dance (both spontaneous and planned), specially baked bread, banners and paramets, processions, and other appropriate participative offerings. Creative ways of including children would be the norm.</font></font>&nbsp;</table><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#808080"><b>x</b></font><p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#ffa4a8"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#ffced0"><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><font size="2"><font color="#000000">I believe that the Church is the Whole Company of Christ's Catholic People Militant here on Earth.

Hissed with ill-controlled anger and heavy with vague threat, the words are calculated to fill a parent's heart with panic. Fight or flight are the instinctive reactions, but a parent is wise to do neither. The wrong understanding betrayed by those words is best allowed to wither away in silence.</font>&nbsp;</font> &nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The ideal of controlling devolves from an era when children were seen as the property of their parents, to be constrained to their parents will and used for their parents' profit. As Christians, our role is not the control, but the education of children:</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<ul><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control wins social approval for the parent, but education gives resources to the child.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control gratifies with instant results, but education is gradual and demanding of patience.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control entrenches parental dominance because it must be constantly maintained; but education gives children self-control so that they can mature beyond the need for our teaching.</font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control aims to limit our childrens' behaviour; Education aims to broaden their understanding.</font></font></ul><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">In short, control benefits adults; education benefits children.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Does this mean that children will be rowdy and uncontrolled? Of course not! As children grow in independence and physical ability, their understanding also grows. Parents can capture every opportunity to teach the <b><i>underlying principals </i></b>of Christian deportment, at a level appropriate to a child's understanding. For example, even very young children can understand:</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<ul><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">You must love God; you may not annoy other people; you must take care of yourself <b><i>(the Great Commandment)</i></b></font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">If you don't like it when someone does it to you, probably they don't like it when you do it to them <b><i>(the golden rule)</i></b></font></font><li> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Stronger people take care of weaker people, big people take care of little people <b><i>(the rule of Chivalry)</i></b></font></font></ul><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Gradually parents teach their children to discern behaviours that reflect underlying principals. A thoughtful heart driving thoughtful behaviour is more reliable than stern control overriding a rebellious heart! From time to time children push the limits of acceptable behaviour, signalling that it is time for the parents to refine further on the child's understanding. Sometimes the child's response to such limitsetting is loud, sometimes gracious; but the parent's role in limit-setting need not be obtrusive. If others don't notice a parent setting limits, it may be their awareness, not the parent's discipline, that's falling short. All that matters is that the child notices!</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">There is one other overriding reason that we cannot treat our children as possessions under our control. With infant baptism, our children become children of God: the precise status that we enjoy ourselves! God has no grandchildren. In baptism our children become our <i>brothers and sisters</i> in Christ. It would be grossly inappropriate to domineer or usurp authority over them. Rather, as Ananias taught Paul, as Prisca and Acquilla instructed Appollos, as adults encourage one-another to grow to Christian maturity, such are our duties to these little brethren.</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Why though, must we inflict our children on the rest of the community during the slow, challenging period of their education?

In a Church where "worshippers" hiss invective at their victims on their way up to the communion table, I've begun to wonder how long I can lean against the church. Wind, like the prejudices of a long-unchallenged elite, can be heartbreakingly relentless. On the barren atlantic coastline of my ancestral isles, or here on our windswept prairies, the sparse and twisted trees bear silent testimony to the ravaging power of the wind.</font> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">And then we came home one blustery Saturday to find our eighty-year-old poplar lying prone across our garden, its massive trunk stretching across sidewalk and boulevard and fifteen feet out into the street.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <center><img align="absbottom" width="640" height="425" src="apple3.jpg"> </center> <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">God has ways of making you take notice. The tree fell in the one direction that would do no property damage -- straight south away from our house and toward the little apple tree we planted five years ago to commemorate Anne's birth. The loss of that apple tree would have grieved our hearts. The poplar landed less than a millimeter away from the Apple's trunk, ripping off six limbs, but left it standing. It missed a tiny saskatoon on the other side by mere inches, and a parked truck by mere feet. Yet it destroyed nothing. I have had prophetic dreams, waking in a cold sweat with a sense of urgency that haunts me until the dream is interpreted; I broke into the same cold sweat and felt that same urgency, as I surveyed that 600-pound sign from God.</font>&nbsp;</font> &nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">We had known for years that the poplar was dying: it sent out no suckers; spawned no new branches; but we hoped the Apple would have a chance to mature before it lost the shade and shelter of the moribund tree, and we had plans to remove the poplar safely when signs of rot began to show. Fond plans! The arborist said he had never seen a tree, so completely rotten inside, that was still standing; nor one so completely rotten that was so apparently sound. But he also said the Apple would survive the damage.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">That was Saturday. And Sunday I came to church, and experienced once again the sparse attendance at Community of Learners, and watched the children being sent away from their proper role in the Worship to Sunday-School Childcare for their elder's comfort. I endured the frowns of elder women as I kept my little ones in, their scowls as Rachel pointed excitedly at the Cross and called "Jesus! Jesus!"; I thought that we have no missions; no foundations; how new families come once, twice, three times and then no more; no real growth these last fifteen years or more; and I wept. No suckering, no new branches: was ever a Church so completely rotten inside, and so apparently sound?</font>&nbsp;</font> &nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">And then, I remembered the Apple Tree. Our signs of life are small; they are distinct from the formal structures under Vestry and the ACW that have marked our church for so long: Inn from the Cold started by one or two visionaries, Community of Learners an initiative of three women. Our fresh start with a separate service for those disruptive, wine-skin rendering elements is perhaps the trunk of a new tree; and without knowing it some of us have already been grafted onto that tree. I wept more. I know that when the remaining structures crash around us, limbs will be ripped off. We will enter the Kingdom maimed. My heart is breaking for the suffering that lies behind us and before us, and an early blizzard howls outside. But outside my parlour window, small but sound and well-rooted, a little Apple-tree leans against the wind.</font> &nbsp;</font></ul></table></center> <center><dd> <font size="-1">Back to <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html">Denizens of the Logrus</a></font> </center> <center><dd> <font color="#ffcc00"><font size="-1">In fall of 1997Saint Stephen's church responded to conflict surrounding the presence of children in worship by establishing separate "contemplative" and "celebratory" services, the celebratory service being planned completely by lay liturgists. Before the "celebratory" eucharist each Sunday, families met as the "Community of Learners" for an hour to prepare for worship: practicing the liturgy and music, and reviewing the meaning of the Scriptures at a simple level. That winter, Vestry, hired a children's education director, and a "contemporary music leader". Within six months, the two services had settled in to the usual BCP-adults-only versus BAS-family-service dichotomy. The hired contemporary music leader took over the music portion of the service planning and the disenfranchised liturgy committee fell apart. The education director took over Sunday School teaching, giving lip-service to the idea of incorporating children in worship but in practice dis-incorporating the laity from responsibility for&nbsp; the children on Sunday, even the responsibility they had previously born as volunteer Sunday-school teachers. The coffee-time was placed between the earlier "Traditional" and later "Contemporary" services, which timing certain of the elderly women used to continue to castigate "troublemakers" with children. Since fall of 1998, the author has ceased to attend Saint Stephens weekly.</font></font> </center><li><h2><a href="/Parenting-ToddlerChurch/">Parenting Toddlerchurch</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"><html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"><meta name="Author" content="Pamela Jane Mclean"><meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/4.05 [en] (WinNT; U) [Netscape]"><meta name="Description" content="Some ideas and principles to follow, to make it easier to bring toddlers to Worship, and hearty encouragement for the parents who do so."><title>Parenting -- Ideas and Insights -- Toddlers in Church</title><body text="#ffff00" bgcolor="#008080" link="#ff00ff" vlink="#ffff80" alink="#ffffff" background="pd.jpg">&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <center><table border="1" cols="3" width="80%" bgcolor="#ffcc99"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"> <center><dd> <b><font color="#000000"><font size="+2">Toddlers in Church</font></font></b> </center> <center><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Ideas for Parents, Insights for others</font></font></b></center> <center><font color="#000000"><font size="-2"></font></font><a href="mailto:Pamela_Mclean@shaw.wave.ca"><font color="#000000"><font size="-2">to comment on these opinions email </font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size="-2"><a href="mailto:Pamela@logrus.ca">Pamela@logrus.ca</a></font></font></center><tr><td><a href="Parenting-control.html"><img src="arrowyg-l.gif" border="0" height="40" width="112" align="middle"> </a><td> <center><b><font color="#000000"><font size="-1">November 1997</font></font></b></center><td><div align="right"><a href="Parenting-spareRod.html"><img alt="Next essay" src="arrowyg.gif" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 112px; height: 40px;" align="middle"> </a></div><tr><td colspan="3"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">As a parent, you usually find no shortage of advice on how to handle your children. For example, when bringing your children to church, you hear that you can use the back or side aisles to walk your fussy baby, and that you should bring crayons and paper for older children to draw the themes of the lessons and sermon. Hmmn. Good ideas both, but walking won't calm a fussy nine-month old, and even a thirty-month-old is unlikely to produce focused artwork. You can't find much advice on dealing with toddlers in church, because there simply are no obvious strategies. Babies predictably lack all verbal skills and motor control, so we can predict that certain things will comfort them; pre-schoolers have essentially the same language a</font></b> <b><font size="+1"> nd nervous maturity as adults though with less experience, so we can expect certain behaviours from them. But toddlers by definition are somewhere between the complete lack of verbal and nervous developement that characterises a baby, and the relative maturity that characterises a child. And they're traversing the gap at breakneck speed.</font></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">When confronted with toddlerhood let's face it, most parents just give up and resort to the nursery "until he reaches a stage where he can behave in church". I can sympathise, but that's a lot like deciding not to talk to your child until he can use full sentences, or not to bother with giving him dishes until he figures out table manners. The biggest thing your toddler is learning over these two years is to relate: to relate the ME to the NOT-ME, to relate his body to the space he occupies, to relate physical objects to his control of them, and to relate how living things respond to his own responses. Will he learn to relate to God? A lot depends on whether we let him respond to God during his toddler years.</font></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">So, hard as it is, bring your toddler to church.

I've dumped the problem back in your lap. I'd rather have your toddler in my lap than your problems, anyhow. But for free, here are some equally reliable suggestions:</font></b> &nbsp;</font>&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<ul><blockquote><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2"> Let your child wander within limits. </font></i><font size="+1">A person who has just learned how to walk has a highly developed spacial awareness. Such a person would be as frustrated by not being allowed to move around, as you would be if you were told to keep your eyes closed.</font></font></b></blockquote><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Limit your child to what you are comfortable with. </font></i><font size="+1">You may be comfortable with your child is anywhere on the Nave </font>(or "sanctuary")<font size="+1"> floor, but not if she goes into the Chancel or climbs on the pews. If your anxiety level peaks don't worry about being overly controlling: rein her in. Then remember, and enforce that limit from then on. As soon as she breaches the limit, fetch her back a distance, state the limit, and let her go again.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Don't reward fusses. </font></i><font size="+1">If you have to remove your child, take him into the narthex or other area, but give him LESS freedom than he'd have in church. For example, hold him still on your lap. If he's fussing from tiredness or overstimulation that should calm him better than letting him run around, and if not it will make being in church preferable to being removed. Eventually - over four to six months of this treatment - he may start to quiet as soon as you stand up with him.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Beware of growth spurts </font></i><font size="+1">which cause ravenous hunger and nervous stress. Have biscuits or cereal for your toddler to snack on, and something cuddly for her to curl up with if she's tired.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DON'T try to DISTRACT a fussy toddler -- DO try to ENGAGE her. </font></i><font size="+1">A liturgical church is full of vivid sensual experiences. Draw his attention to the action of the Eucharist - "Look, Father has the Holy Bread! Do you see the Holy Bread? Where's the Holy Bread?" - or to the stained glass, or to familiar symbols like the cross, or to other worshippers. After a baptism, let him touch the water, and draw a cross on his forehead like the one on the baby's forehead. DEFINATELY let him take the communion. Provide toys if you can, that also draw the focus back to the worship: bible-based activity blankets or stuffed bible-toys, or scriptural soft books. But remember the first rule of toddlerhood: there ARE no quiet toys. You just have to modulate the noise the best you can, and try not to worry.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DON'T stifle your child's response to God. </font></i><font size="+1">If he points and shouts "Cross! Cross!" at the Gospel procession, great! You can reinforce his enthusiasm AND model appropriate vocal control at the same time, by murmuring "Yes, my dear, that's the Cross! Good for you". But vocal modulation is generally not a developmentally appropriate emphasis at this age.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DO bow your head and steeple your hands</font></i><font size="+1">, make the sign of the cross, bow at the name of Jesus, and teach your child to do these things too. Children like games with rules, and these are the "rules" for worshipping. Later when they're teenagers they can rebel by not bowing their heads, and they won't have to run away to feel appropriately rebellious.</font></font></b><li> <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Give your child money to put in the offering plate</font></i><font size="+1"> as soon as she recognises what money is and can be counted on not to swallow it. Make the offering the purpose of your child's allowance: she gets two pennies SO that she can give one to God. As soon as she understands counting to 10, give her 10 pennies, and insist that one is for God. As she gets older, give her her allowance in multiples of 10 right before church (or on Saturday night if you feel giving allowance constitutes breaking the Sabbath) so that it's always easy to tithe. Inure yourself to the sound of pennies falling on the floor: i<span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 51);">f enough supporters had le</span></font></font><font style="color: rgb(51, 0, 51);" size="+1">arned to tithe as children, the church could afford a carpet.&nbsp;</font></b></ul></table></center> <center><font size="-1">Back to <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html">Denizens of the Logrus</a></font></center> b<li><h2><a href="/sacglori/">Sacglori</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><html><head><title>Logrus: choreography - Tadmen Gloria</title><meta content="Pamela Jane Mclean" name="Author"><meta content="Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win95; I) [Netscape]" name="GENERATOR"><body background="pd.jpg" alink="#000000" vlink="#ffff80" link="#ffff00" bgcolor="#c0c0c0" text="#ffffff"> <center><h1><font color="#993399"><small><small><b><font size="+4"><small><small> This is just a shadow of the Logrus.

In 1985 when Gayda Erret presented a brief workshop on liturgical dance, few people even knew the term. Literature on the subject was available, but it was much harder to acquire than today. Since then however, liturgical dance has been demonstrated at the Christian Festival in 1986; and folk-dancing, which is one of the sources of liturgical dance, has been featured at Theology Alive. Dance has been used in services at several churches in the Diocese of Calgary; notably Saint Stephen's, Holy Nativity, Saint Lukes, and Saint George's. With the establishment in1991 of the Christian Dance Fellowship of Canada, the time has come for liturgical dance to move from being a theoretical consideration to being an accepted form of worship. Although the majority of conservative churchgoers may still be unacquainted with it, many members have had the opportunity to experience liturgical dance. In other countries it is well accepted: Australia has had a national Christian Dance Fellowship since the mid-seventies; and in the United States there are Christian dance companies, seminars and conventions. In Calgary, Christian dance seminars have been held at several churches and at Theology Alive. These varied dance experiences include pioneering work and experimentation, of which we can take advantage. They bring out several considerations which must accompany the introduction of liturgical dance into a worshipping community. These questions of form and function must be resolved by all the liturgists: dancers, clergy, and other worship leaders together. </font><p><b><i><font size="+1">Considerations of Function </font></i></b><p><font size="+1">Foremost, the liturgists must consider what role dance should play in worship, and what form it should take. Dance is a worship resource, over which liturgists are called to exercise careful stewardship, that it may best be used to build up the church. In any given church, some of the forms of dance described below may be deemed inappropriate. Other forms may be needed and developed. In no case should dance be a performance grafted on to the liturgy and serving no purpose. It must meet a need within the three-fold pattern of worship -- praise, instruction or petition. </font><p><font size="+1">1) Dance as an act of the worshipping community </font><ul><p><font size="+1">Praise and petition are often corporate, meaning that the whole congregation acts together, as when singing hymns or reciting the Lords prayer. Corporate acts are directed from the people toward God. Corporate dance is performed by members of the congregation, without any special training or practice. This form of dance is characteristic of Quaker and Shaker worship, and typically employs a line or circle of dancers using simple folk-dance steps like the "grapevine". The people follow a lead dancer, from whom they pick up the steps. One case when corporate dance might be used in formal worship is the Palm Sunday procession. In general however, corporate dance is unsuitable to formal worship. The usual furnishings of church buildings permit only limited movement except in the aisles, and movement in and out of the aisles is restricted. Instead corporate dance could be used during informal worship, such as at the church picnic or at a home eucharist. </font></ul><p><font size="+1">2) Dance as an offering from practiced dancers</font><ul><p><font size="+1">Praise and petition may also be representative, meaning that part of the congregation acts on behalf of the rest, as when a minister leads the prayers of the people or the choir offers an anthem. Representative dance is the form most readily integrated into the regular service: A few trained dancers can move with grace and dignity in the aisles; and the form is ideally suited to processions, which are already a part of the service. In fact danced processionals may be a more valid form of representative praise even than choral anthems, since movement in and out of the nave is a simple necessity and not an adjunct. Whether offerings or items of worship are being borne into the church, or people are moving through the nave, the precedent exists for them to be accompanied by dancing: from the books of Joshua and I Kings we know that dancers and musicians proceeded the Ark of God, and the rest of the people followed. </font></ul><p><font size="+1">3) Dance as Ministry</font><ul><p><font size="+1">Unlike praise and petition, instruction is directed not toward God, but from one individual to the rest of the people, as when a reader reads the scripture or a preacher preaches. Instructional dance is the form of liturgical dance most common in Pentecostal worship; and is the form most reminiscent of a performanceand therefor least appropriate to inexperienced dancers. Also called interpretive dance, it helps people learn through the eye and the heart, what they would learn from a reader or preacher through the ear and the mind. Interpretive dance can be performed during a scripture reading to the actual words of the text, in which case it may be much like mime. It can also be performed to music after the reading to reinforce its message, or be performed instead of the reading to sung lyrics that are based on the reading. Interpretive dance can also illustrate or take the place of the sermon. </font></ul><p><b><i><font size="+1">Considerations of Form </font></i></b><p><font size="+1">Although the function of liturgical dance determines its essential form, the liturgists must consider independently the style and quality of liturgical dance to be used in worship. People with limited exposure to liturgical dance often think of their one particular experience of it as normative; they assume that liturgical dance is aesthetically monolithic. In fact, various styles of dance can be presented within the context of the liturgy. The styles of dance used should be compatable with the style of worship; and of course regardless of its style, liturgical dance must aspire to excellence if it is to be a suitable offering to God. Elements of style include postures and movements in the dance, choice of music, and costume. </font><p><font size="+1">1) Incorporating Church Traditions </font><ul><p><font size="+1">To be completely integrated in the worship, liturgical dance should evolve out of existing familiar symbols, ideas and traditions. Dance is simply disciplined movement, shaped by rhythm and aspiring to beauty. The practice of kneeling, the careful gestures of the priest celebrating the eucharist, and the dignified movement of communicants to and from the altar rail, are primitive dances with which we are intimately familiar. An intrinsic style of liturgical dance would incorporate the vertical kneeling-standing movement, gestures of respect for the Bread and Cup, and processional movement. It would express ideas in well-known ways, by turning to show repentance or leaping to show faith. It would sometimes use characteristic music such as plainchant, Psalter melodies, and ancient-office hymns; and draw costuming themes from the dramatic colours of the liturgical year. Dance might augment familiar customs such as the advent wreath or the creche, and might potentially discover a symbology for the long, unceremonious season of Trinity. </font></ul><p><font size="+1">2) Adapting a Dance Tradition </font><ul><p><font size="+1">Although dance evolves from ordinary worship movement, it should be polished by training and practice. Dance training is broadly available only in secular schools, and falls into certain catagories: ballet, jazz, modern and folk being the most common examples. A liturgical dance leader will typically be trained in one of these styles, and adapt it to liturgical dance. Each of these schools provides a set of steps and stances which provide the foundation of the dance. To dancers who are familiar with them these steps are so basic as not to merit consideration. However, even the most classic movements of a particular style may seem unsuitable in church. Certain pas de deux of ballet, for example, or the basic hip-movements of middle-eastern dance, might give offence to some observers -- to the utter bemusement of the dancers. Other choreography may seem "too irreverent" or "too idolatrous". Since the dancers may be too close to their work to be sensitive to these unintended implications, the other liturgists may choose to preview each dance before it is offered in church. </font></ul><p><font size="+1">3) Music </font><ul><p><font size="+1">The music chosen will further shape the style of liturgical dance, and should also reflect the appropriate church and dance traditions. Much liturgical dance is done to "praise and worship" music -- an easy-listening style of vocal music, usually by a soloist such as Steve Green or John Michael Talbot. Although an unfamiliar style of music in conservative churches, "praise and worship" music may be more acceptable than the more vigourous Christian rock of musicians like Keith Green or Petra. Symphonic or chamber music, the usual accompaniment for secular dance, is another option. Lovely symphonic religious music is available, including masses both classical and modern; but it is more demanding on the dancers and less adaptable than vocal music. Madrigals, plainchant and ancient-office hymns present similar challenges to the dancers and choreographers. Some folk-hymns, especially those rooted in the Israeli and Shaker musical traditions, and a few standard hymn-tunes, are excellent for corporate dancing. </font><p><font size="+1">Whatever music is used, recordings must be obtained for practice, preferably on compact disc. (Compact disc players can be programmed to play selections in a prescribed order, or to jump to a specific location in a piece for repeated practice of a difficult step.) "Praise and worship" music, symphonic music, and Christian rock are readily available. They are available in such quantity and with such range of suitability, in fact, that discriminating which pieces may be useful is a daunting task. Hymns and folk-hymns are less common, but the choir may consent to be recorded on tape during a choir-practice, for use later at dance-practice. </font></ul><p><font size="+1">4) Costume </font><ul><p><font size="+1">Costume is one aspect of liturgical dance which has no clear traditional or theological foundation. The secular schools mentioned above (except for folk, which avoids the problem by using national dress) generally use minimal clothing so that the movements of the dance are unimpeded and can be clearly seen. Valerie Henry insists that her dancers wear support-undergarments, leotards, tights, under-cullottes to cover the legs during spins, opaque full-circle ankle-length skirts, long-sleeved peasant-style blouses, and decorative overtunics. This costume is pretty and feminine, one size fits most dancers, and it is unlikely to offend even the most puritanical onlooker. However other dancers have suggested that such excessive emphasis on propriety of dress is unhealthy. Since the positioning of limbs matters less than the line of the movement, the texture of costume material should be considered: circle-skirts look very graceful when the dancers spin, but unless made of a filmy material they do obscure other movements. Other possibilities include a simpler skirt-and-blouse combination or dress; long full tunics similar to choir surplices with or without under-cassocks; straight-cut ankle-length tunics, possibly with side-seams open below the knee to allow movement; or simple loose-fitting trousers with tunic, such as a punjab suit. Different tabard-like overtunics and coloured sashes can be added to any of these for dramatic effect, so the colour of the basic costume should be chosen to coordinate easily. </font></ul><p><b><i><font size="+1">In conclusion </font></i></b><p><font size="+1">Liturgical dance is a challenge to the conservative churches. We need it, both to affirm those whom God has called to dance, and to feed those saints who hunger for creative expression in worship. We need it to reclaim the sacredness of our bodies. Yet precisely because we have denied them for so long, we are reluctant now to recognise these needs. Rather than allowing that reluctance to become an barrier to liturgical dance, liturgists are invited to apply the above considerations and create a well-ordered and non-threatening plan for the admission of dance in worship.</font> <center><p><font size="-1"><a href="file://c:/My%20Documents/pamela/html%27s/logrus/denizens.html#pamela"> Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center> <li><h2><a href="/sacdance/">Sacdance</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><html><head><meta http-equiv="CONTENT-TYPE" content="text/html; charset=windows-1252"><title></title><meta name="GENERATOR" content="OpenOffice.org 1.0.2 (Win32)"><meta name="CREATED" content="20031115;23383897"><meta name="CHANGED" content="16010101;0"><style> <!-- P { color: #ffffff } A:link { color: #ffff00 } A:visited { color: #ffff80 } --></style><body lang="en-US" text="#ffffff" link="#ffff00" vlink="#ffff80" bgcolor="#c0c0c0" background="pd.jpg"><p><font size="4">Liturgical Dance: <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/sacworsh.html">Considerations for Worship Committees</a></font><p><font size="4">Choreography: <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/sacourfa.html">Our Father</a> (Tadmen setting)</font><p><font size="4">Choreography: <a href="http://www.logrus.ca/sacglori.html">Gloria</a> (Tadmen setting)</font><li><h2><a href="/wedgifts/">Wedgifts</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><html><head><title>Logrus Etiquette: Registering for wedding gifts</title><meta name="Author" content="Pamela Jane Mclean"><meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win95; I) [Netscape]"><body text="#ffffff" bgcolor="#c0c0c0" link="#ffff00" vlink="#ffff80" alink="#000000" background="pd.jpg"> <center><h1><font color="#993399"><small><small><b><font size="+4"><small><small> This is just a shadow of the Logrus.

A wise couple will consider first, what household goods they already possess; next, what possessions would grace thier home of dreams; and finally what they wish to acquire, replace or dispose of, to bring the reality and dreams together. High standards and a long view will never be in error. </font><p><font size="+1">By all means, a bride should register. Much crass advice is given that registering helps guests choose appropriate gifts and prevents duplicate gifts. No gently-bred bride would dream of influencing her guests in this way; indeed, she expects no gifts at all. But registering greatly helps a bride plan the trousseau which, acquired over the years, will graciously complement her way of life. Good shops retain such records for many years -- and the very best shops will keep such a registry for a good customer of whatever marital status. </font><p><font size="+1">In planning tableware, consider how you will entertain. If you never serve a formal dinner, acquire only glassware, stoneware and stainless steel; if you never entertain casually, acquire only crystal, porcelaine and silver. Unused "Wedding China" is a silly affectation. Determine the minimum courses you will serve, and obtain first the pieces you will need for that, ignoring the china-shop's definition of a "place setting" (a china-shop's "place setting" contains five pieces, only two of which are correctly used at a formal dinner). Consider also how many guests you will sit down at one time: four, eight or twelve guests (in addition to the host and hostess) are pleasant numbers. </font><p><font size="+1">A young couple who are beginning to practice hospitality, will do well to try first simple three-course meals; first for one another, then for only four guests. Thus for soup, a meat course, and cake -- a gracious example -- they should have available: six each soup-plates, dinner-plates, glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each dinner-knives, dinner-forks, salad forks, and dessert spoons; six red-wine glasses; a soup-toureen, a platter, two vegetable dishes, and a cake plate; a soup ladle, carving knife and fork, two serving spoons and a cake knife. Alternately for a meat course, salad, and pudding they should have available: six each dinner-plates, salad plates, glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each soup-spoons, dinner-knives, dinner-forks, dessert forks; six red-wine glasses; a platter, two vegetable dishes, a salad bowl, and a pudding bowl; a carving knife and fork, two serving spoons, salad servers and a pudding spoon.</font><p><font size="+1">If one has acquired for each cover -- a "cover" being that which the china-shops call a "place setting" -- a large spoon, a large knife, and a large fork; the most versatile piece of cutlery to obtain next is a smaller fork, which may serve as a fish-fork, salad-fork, dessert-fork, or for the appetizer course. Dinner-plates, ten inches in diameter, are the most necessary piece of china; followed by eight-inch plates which may serve for salad, appetizer or dessert. Soup-plates are used only for soup and so may seem dispenable; but may be omitted only at the cost of omitting to serve soup. </font><p><font size="+1">A silver-chest which contains for each cover a soup-spoon, fish-knife and fish-fork, dinner-knife and dinner-fork, lunch-knife and lunch-fork, salad-fork, dessert-fork, dessert-spoon, tea-spoon, coffee-spoon and demitasse-spoon; and appropriate serving-pieces; will meet the most ambitious requirements of most couples. Similarly even the best-stocked china cupboard rarely contains more than soup-plates, cover-plates, ten-inch plates, six-inch plates, glass eight-inch plates, tea-cups and saucers, coffee-cups and saucers,demi-tasses and saucers, and three sets of eight-inch plates; and serving dishes.</font> <center><p><font size="-1">if you're looking for a church marriage in Calgary Alberta, see also: <a href="StSmarry.html">getting married at Saint Stephen's</a></font> </center> <center><p><font size="-1"><a href="denizens.html#pamela">Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center><p> <li><h2><a href="/wedgroom/">Wedgroom</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><html><head><title>Logrus Etiquette: Notes for the Groom</title><meta name="Author" content="Pamela Jane Mclean"><meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win95; I) [Netscape]"><body text="#ffffff" bgcolor="#c0c0c0" link="#ffff00" vlink="#ffff80" alink="#000000" background="pd.jpg"> <center><h1><font color="#993399"><small><small><b><font size="+4"><small><small> This is just a shadow of the Logrus.

"Correctly attired" offers no scope for innovation: it means grey cutaways and striped trousers before six o'clock and black evening-dress with tails afterward. "Appropriately attired" offers slightly more variety: grey "strollers" might replace the cutaways or a black dinner-jackets replace the tail-coats. White or grey dinner-jackets -- though still with black trousers -- might be risked by an adventuresome groom. Or, at risk of appearing too casual, three-piece suits might be worn: black, or grey if before six o'clock. Shirts are always white and unruffled, but if no vest be worn the shirt-front may be pleated. True sartorial adventure, however, is allowed in the choice of ties and cumberbunds. Unless wearing tail-coats, in which case the gentlemen are restricted to black or white ties and cumberbunds (a wing-tip collar being allowed if white is chosen), these items may be of any colour, or even patterned. A wedding not being Broadway, there need not be equal numbers of groomsmen and bridesmaids coordinated by height and costume: the staging of the processional is to be adapted to the dear friends who will take part, not friends chosen to suit the processional. Yet by coincidence, nearly all grooms choose exactly the number of attendants that their brides, if given any say, would have wished; and most brides on their wedding-day are unsurprised by how the groomsmen dress -- even when they appear in the most inappropriate puce trousers with ruffled pink shirts. </font><p><font size="+1">On festive occasions, a gentleman always sends flowers to a woman whom he admires. In general, a gentleman who sends flowers to several women at once is a cad; but on this occasion when he makes the transition from son to husband (and son-in-law) he wisely sends corsages to his mother and his mother-in-law to be, and an impressive bouquet to his bride. The bride sees her bouquet for the first time when it arrives as a gift from her groom on the day of her wedding, but -- again purely by coincidence -- the groom's choice of flowers always coordinates perfectly with the the bride's dress, and with the bouquets she herself has provided for her bridesmaids. </font><p><font size="+1">The groom buys a wedding ring and has it engraved. He also purchases the marriage license, and pays the cleric who performs the wedding, discreetly slipping him a envelope containing the fee -- so that the bride need never know that the wedding was sullied by any commercial transaction. </font><p><font size="+1">And once wed, the groom whisks his bride away on a splendid trip which he has planned and paid for, impressing her not only with this evidence of his ability to take charge of such details, but also with his cleverness in choosing just the destination she herself would have chosen. </font> <center><p><font size="-1">if you're looking for a church marriage in Calgary Alberta, see also: <a href="StSmarry.html">getting married at Saint Stephen's</a></font> </center> <center><p><font size="-1"><a href="denizens.html#pamela">Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center><p> <li><h2><a href="/wedmaids/">Wedmaids</a></h2><p><!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"><html><head><title>Logrus Etiquette: The Bridal Party</title><meta name="Author" content="Pamela Jane Mclean"><meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/3.01Gold (Win95; I) [Netscape]"><body text="#ffffff" bgcolor="#c0c0c0" link="#ffff00" vlink="#ffff80" alink="#000000" background="pd.jpg"><center><p><font size="+4">The Bridal Party</font> </center><p><font size="+1">A maiden marrying from her mother's home should choose a maid of honour of a similar age, with whom she can share intimate confidences. An independent spinster who is planning her own wedding should choose as matron of honour a senior woman who has previously planned a wedding or who has entertained formally; who can affirm the bride's wiser decisions and advise her of her less wise decisions. In either case, the honour attendant should be a dear and trusted friend. In selecting gowns for herself and her attendants, a bride should consider that they will for some time be standing with their backs to the congregation. Thus, the gowns should incorporate significant design interest on the back, as well as the front: A train, bows, flounces, and appliques are such examples. The bride's mother, in fact anyone not in the actual wedding party, must be considered wise enough to choose her own apparel. In general, attendants provide their own apparel, according with the bride's wishes. A thoughtful bride therefor chooses no dress for her maids that proves unflattering, or impractical for later wear. Often the honour attendant is dressed differently from the other maids, and indeed all may be dressed differently, their costumes linked only by some consistency in design or colour. All gentlemen in a wedding party properly dress alike. </font> <center><p><font size="-1">if you're looking for a church marriage in Calgary Alberta, see also: <a href="http://www.ststephenscalgary.org/weddings.htm">getting married at Saint Stephen's</a></font> </center> <center><p><font size="-1"><a href="http://www.logrus.ca/denizens.html#pamela">Back to "Denizens of the Logrus"</a></font> </center><p> </ul></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
