If you work two 60-hour weeks in a row, your productivity for the next two weeks will be crap. Lots of baby-boomer professionals believe they are “special” and that norm doesn’t apply to them; so they try to set a standard of working over-long days – and they close their eyes to the fact that they pretty soon HAVE to work eighty-hour weeks just to produce the thirty-hours worth of value they would produce if they took care of themselves (all the while holding themselves up as exemplars of a “sound work ethic”).<li><h2><a href="/old-school-conservative/">Old School Conservative</a></h2><p>People told me “If you aren’t liberal when you’re young you’re heartless.

Maybe you’ll never know WHAT you broke.<li><h2><a href="/Adulting-Classes/">Adulting Classes</a></h2><p>Millenials now have the option of taking "Adulting Classes" -- privately, because the school system no longer offers Home Ec, Shop, Civics, Photography and so on. And boomer media is mocking millenials for having the practicality to go out and get the skills they have been deprived of. Because make no mistake: this is not about millenials being "coddled" or "snowflakes". This is about boomer priorities deliberately minimizing the next generations options.<li><h2><a href="/Does-the-world-need-hard-work/">Does The World Need Hard Work</a></h2><p>A meme came over my dashboard today proclaiming that "The world needs more individuals who are willing to work their hardest."

I haven't read the entire act, but I did confirm the increased voter ID requirements. While they're not insane, they will make it harder for some people to vote, which means they'll probably do more harm than good, since (as the petition points out) evidence suggests that voter fraud by individuals is a fantasy.</P> <P>Voter turnout in the last federal election was barely over 61%.

I can find the white and the pink, but am unable to find a deep pink/red/purple one for Christmas. I know the Lutheran Church in our area uses blue and white. I think the minister said it had something to do with separating Advent and Lent so the colors didn't confuse people? ## Answer: Hmm, white and pink with a red Christmas candle is a new combination for me... I'm used to four purples and a white, with the radical Catholic part of me leaning toward three purples, a pink, and a white. Some Swedish Lutherans -- the inventors of the Advent Wreath -- are surprised that the candles are any colour but white. And many Lutherans use four blue candles. My Metis mother-in-law uses Red, Yellow, Blue and Green because those are the colours of the Four Corners of the Earth on a Medicine Wheel. The advent wreath is just a custom, not a doctrine or tradition, so do whatever works to create more reverence and devotion in your home. Blue paraments is a Lutheran thing -- and good liturgy, since purple is for penance, and Advent is more preparatory than penitential (although all preparation has a penitential aspect). It does have some historical basis, along with other obscure colours like rose-pink paraments for festivals of the Blessed Virgin and black paraments for Ash Wednesday; although I don't know whether any of those less-common colours have historical basis in the non-Roman catholic churches.<li><h2><a href="/what-did-you-tell-your-children/">What Did You Tell Your Children</a></h2><p>## Question: What did you tell your children about 9-11? ##Answer: I answer my children with the truth, always. Sometimes, though, I am glad when they don't ask... In this case, I heard the news at the filling station, while trying to put enough pressure into the two flat front tires (which I discovered when I got to the Wanda-Wagon this morning) to allow me to limp to the tire-shop without damaging the rim. The station attendant came and told me the news. Since Wanda is a rag-top the children heard what he was saying, though his agitation and heavy accent garbled the message somewhat. So they asked me to explain what he had said. I was still trying to make sense of it myself -- I told them that two air-liners had crashed, which is what I thought he had said. The girls are aviation buffs, after their father; they realized the seriousness of that. (I never dreamed I'd be wishing that was *all* it had been.) When Dean picked us all up at the tire shop, he had the radio on, so they heard the news as we did. We kept turning it off for a minute to re-state it for the children and allow them to ask questions, which we answered as simply and factually as we could. I wept through a couple of the answers, apart from which I tried to stay matter-of-fact. I several times used the words "I don't know why. It was wrong and evil." They talked about it a little in school; the school like us believes in giving children facts and letting them explore together the meaning and implications of those facts. Rachel's class, the grade two/threes, came to a consensus that the people who did it had done very wrong, but that they were dead, too. When I picked her up from school, she seemed comfortable with that. She recognised that I was still sad and worried, and hugged me protectively. Anne's class (grade four/five) seems mostly to have skirted the matter of motivation. She seemed less comfortable with it. She didn't talk about it, but at dinner she made a rude and challenging comment to something DH said about the event (he had been talking about the emergency response teams). I explained to her that the people he had been talking about had gone into the building to save others, and had been killed, willfully giving their lives to save others -- and that many of them were parents who would not come home. She got somber, and didn't say anything else. I think it may take her a long time to process this; maybe I came down too hard on her. Navigating through Anne's obsessiveness and hyper-restraint, without under-challenging her or letting her armour herself with flippancy, may be the biggest challenge of my parenting.<li><h2><a href="/explaining-9-11-in-Sunday-School/">Explaining 9 11 In Sunday School</a></h2><p><p>##I’m wondering how to handle it if the attacks come up in Sunday School…<li><h2><a href="/us/pamela/Bibles-for-children/">Bibles For Children</a></h2><p>I am interested in purchasing a book or two for my 3 yr old.

It's also my preferred text in most cases for reading Scripture aloud, since it permits the meaning to be followed easily by the majority of the audience. For rigourous study, more subtle and scholarly translations are preferable, but most serious students use more than one translation anyway.

The poor illustrations aren't a good sign. </P> <P>I am not a fan of &quot;kiddie&quot; prayers and songs. For devotions we simply use the Traditional ancient prayers of the church, the same that are used for adults. We started with the simplest prayers, combining them with extempore prayer. Children are excellent rote learners as you know if you have ever mis-read a word in their favourite story-book; so it doesn't take them long to add a new prayer or hymn to their repertoire. Since the Traditional prayers are rich in scriptural references, this technique writes the words of Scripture in their hearts. We taught them one at a time, starting with Nunc Dimittus (&quot;Lord lettest now thy servant depart in peace&quot;), since that is in &quot;A book about Jesus&quot; and the children had already learned it just from hearing the story over and over. The Lord's Prayer was one of the next, and Kontakion -- I can't remember which they learned first. </P> <P>But that being said, someone gave Anne a copy of Classic Children's Prayers <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564</A> (which I tried to ignore) and both children have memorized all the prayers in it and use them freely, so you might find such a thing a good resource. It's a board book, so the children can play with it and take ownership of it, without wearing it out. While I was looking for the reference at Amazon I also found this beautiful book containing some of the same prayers, and more: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564</A> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P>For yourself, I think what you're looking for is more a Bible Companion than a concordance. </P> <P>A concordance is for looking up words in the bible, and how they were translated. If, for example, you remember a fragment of a quote, you can look up one of the words from the quote in your concordance and it will give you all the passages where that word occurs. The best-known English concordance is Strong's, which is a concordance of the King James Version. It also contains notes about how the individual Hebrew and Greek words were translated by the KJV translators. You can get this function online and save your money: one of my favourite such sites is the Blue Letter Bible: <A HREF="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</A> </P> <P>Another tool you might be thinking of, is a commentary. A commentary is a set of notes on the passages of Scripture. It is arranged book by book, chapter by chapter, verse by verse; so that as you read along in the Bible you can also see what various scholars have to say about the passage you are reading. Here's a previous discussion of commentaries: </P> <P><A HREF="http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html">http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html</A> </P> <P>Note that that discussion was in the context of quite scholarly commentaries. It is actually easier to find simpler and more readable commentaries than it is to find the hard ones. </P> <P>A bible companion, or a bible history or bible atlas helps you find the cultural, historical, and geographic context around the events that you are reading about. It may not deal with the passage itself, but will tell you about the countries, climates, and culture in which the passage was written. Here's one that several people have recommended (I don't have one myself): </P> <P><A HREF="http://makeashorterlink.com/?W2D735443">http://makeashorterlink.com/?W2D735443</A> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> </BODY> </HTML><li><h2><a href="/us/pamela/childcare/">Childcare</a></h2><p>QUESTION: Why have children if you're going to let someone else raise them?

Work can be a dreary hopeless grind, which is a consequence of the fall and no part of God's plan for us. Or work can be a challenging and rewarding experience that adds value to your day, because we are using God-given talents, a sure sign that we are doing God's will for us.<BR><BR>That same study of history, or of economics for that matter, will show you that the normal human condition is laid out in community, with different people undertaking different tasks so that the whole community's needs are met. And those tasks are rewarded in different ways, wages and salaries being only one kind of reward and not necessarily the best. Money is a good symbol of value received, but it is not value per se. If we start categorizing people's work as unselfish based on whose name is on the deposit slip, or selfish based on whose name is on the withdrawal slip, we're misapplying the symbol. Within the community, someone -- a wife, a husband, a grandparent, a hand-maid, a daycare -- needs to be caring for the children at any given time. And someone needs to plant the fields, and dig the wells, and maintain the Internet infrastructure. And no one person can do all of it, so we rely on one another.<BR><BR>That woman in Proverbs 31 who was trading in flax in the marketplace and spinning it, planting vineyards with the fuit of her hands, managing a household staff, and weaving tapestries of purple -- she was working! And she had help with her children, or what were all those handmaids doing after she gaveth them their portion? Today we have daycare as an alternative to handmaids (and we have live-in grandparents, and Filipino nannies, and day-homes, and other choices too). Daycare may be &quot;meant&quot; for single parent families but that does not imply that those are the only families it is meant for. It's for <I><B>whoever </B></I>is being called by God <U>or </U>constrained by necessity to do some work that precludes caring for children for the duration of that work. And no-one -- NO-ONE -- can decide who that is except the person who faces that Call or that Necessity. <BR><BR>But whether you are called to be with your own children 24/7, or whether you are called to care for the children of others and receive a wage for doing it, or whether you are relying on someone you have chosen to provide that care for your own children while you work at something else, is not the determiner of whether your children are well-reared or not. People who use childcare alternatives <U>are </U>still rearing their own children. The caregivers have considerable influence, but it doesn't begin to outweigh the parents' if the parents care to use their influence.

We are in Confirmation classes now, but wow...there is alot to learn. Also...you go to a Lutheran church right now, am I right or confused? Is there much of a difference in Episcopal and Lutheran? </FONT> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT> </P> <P>Boy, you sure pack some big questions into a small post&lt;g&gt;!</P> <P>ECUSA is &quot;The Episcopal Church of the United States of America&quot;, which is what it's usually called but is not its full legal name. It's properly &quot;PECUSA&quot;, which is the &quot;Protestant Episcopal et cetera&quot;. </P> <P>The Revised Common Lectionary is a system for reading the Bible at the main Sunday service. Using a prescribed cycle of readings (&quot;the lectionary&quot;) at worship is an Anglican principle, addressed in one of the historic prefaces -- it means that everyone in the communion is assured of being exposed to a broad overview of Scripture rather than just the rector's favourite readings; and that everyone gets the same readings at appropriate times, when the activities of the Church year most reinforce them and they can most inform our activities. The Common Lectionary was an ecumenical endeavor to put all the liturgical churches on the same page. Roman Catholics and Lutherans use a lectionary too; and with the ecumenical dialogue of the reforming 60's, and people attending one another's churches and sharing ministry, it made sense to be able to discuss &quot;this Sunday's readings&quot; with one another regardless of denominational affiliation. Also, since the lectionary has a flow from Sunday to Sunday, having a common lectionary means I can go to the Lutheran church this Sunday and the Episcopalian church the next, and not feel like I came in in the middle of the story. </P> <P>The main differences between the Common Lectionary and the historic Anglican lectionary are: </P> <PRE>- addition of an Old Testament reading (we used just to have the Epistle and the Gospel) - a three-year cycle of readings instead of a one-year cycle - harmonization of the Psalter with the readings</PRE><P> The Common Lectionary took a more-or-less sequential read through the Gospels, and selected Epistle, Psalm and Old Testament readings that illustrated the Gospel principle. That meant, however, that you never got a good sequential read through any of the old testament's great stories. There were other wrinkles to be worked out too, hence the *Revised* Common Lectionary. The RCL gives you the option of two Old Testament readings: one sequential, one illustrating the Gospel principles; and two Psalms corresponding to the two Old Testament readings. </P> <P>The Lutheran church is a reformed Catholic church, just as is the Anglican church. It is informed by German culture in the way that the Anglican church is informed by Anglo-Saxon and Celtic culture, so it's music tends to the German hymn-tunes; the liturgical settings are different, and the wording of the liturgy is slightly different (and their words of reception for the newly Baptized are the *WORST EVER* piece of liturgical English I have ever read!) Luther made more of a stamp on his church than the Anglican reformers made on theirs, was more of an individualist, and was more concious of being in schism from Rome; so you often hear Lutherans quoting Luther. I don't think I've ever heard an Anglican quote Cranmer except in an academic setting. Luther was a prolific and powerful writer; and his personal theology tend to inform the Lutheran church and give it a bit of a bias. </P> <P>Luther's battle-cry against Rome was &quot;Sola Gratia, Sola Fidelis, Sola Scriptura&quot; -- so you find less reliance on Tradition and Reason and a correspondingly heavier weighting on Scripture than in the Anglican communion. But overall, Lutherans have the same theology and practice (and breadth of practice) as Anglicans with two heterodox exceptions. The exceptions are </P> <P>1) The Lutheran church has not, or maybe has not, or maybe doesn't want to, or maybe has a different understanding of, *Apostolic Succession*. This is the idea that each Bishop is consecrated by a preceeding Bishop in unbroken chain back to the Apostles. Lutherans have temporary Bishops who go back to being ordinary guys when their five-year term is up. This was the sticking-point on the Common Call to Ministry: Apostolic Succession is very important in the Anglican understanding of Sacrament. </P> <P>2) Lutherans teach that, in the absence of an ordained minister, a layperson can consecrate the Eucharist. This is related to the first heterodoxy: if Bishops are just an administrative function, and priests get their authority from the Bishop so they're nobody special either, then the authority to consecrate the Eucharist is just an administrative function too. And since Lutherans believe that the Real Presence is only present in the Elements during the actual Eucharist, it's accepted practice to toss the leftovers in the trash. It's very hard for me to type this -- I'm a practical modern rational scientist; but I become physically ill at the thought of the Eucharist being abused in this way. Their theology *is* sound, the world *won't* end due to different communion practices, and God *does* transcend -- and sanctify -- even the trashbin in which the uneaten Bread is placed. But I can't bear it: I never go down to tea after service on Communion Sundays for fear I will see something that I would rather be blind to. Incidentally, the teaching flowing out of the Common Call to Ministry is also addressing this conflict. </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P>-- Pamela </P> <P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P> <P><FONT COLOR="#280099">OK...then answer me this...</FONT></P> <P><FONT COLOR="#280099">What is done with our Eucharist? Is it all consumed? I know my SIL who is Catholic says all of their wine is consumed, but I never asked her about the Eucharist. Also, I that the &quot;Protestant&quot; part of the name was dropped. I wonder why, anybody know? </FONT> </P> <P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The &quot;Protestant&quot; thing came up last week on my liturgy e-list., </FONT></SPAN>a list mostly frequented by Lutheran pastors, with a fair sprinkling of episcopals, RCD's and orthodox. &quot;Protestant&quot; is still part of the legal name of the national synod, but the constitution was recently changed to allow &quot;ECUSA&quot; and &quot;the Episcopal Church&quot; to be used in official documents. The person who brought it up on the e-list reprinted the revised preamble of the constitution, but unfortunately I deleted it. </P> <P>Any leftover sacrament that isn't consumed is kept in a special container in the sanctuary called a &quot;tabernacle&quot;, that has a light hanging over it whenever the Reserve Sacramant is in the tabernacle. The light over it is sometimes called the &quot;Presence Lamp&quot;. It's a &quot;high church&quot; custom, and some churches (those that take pride in being &quot;low church&quot; or &quot;evangelical&quot;) consider it an excessively &quot;papist&quot; custom. The bread and wine stored in the tabernacle is called the &quot;Reserved Sacramant&quot;. When the priest or your parish visitation ministers goes visiting, they put the reserved sacrament in a special little box, often silver, called a &quot;Pix&quot;. (There was a horror movie a while ago called &quot;The Pix&quot; -- I didn't see the movie but I presume that's what it about. Hollywood has a fascination with catholic religiosity.) Presumably there's a special name for the little flask too, but I don't know it. A pix is a traditional gift for an ordinand -- they usually come in a set with the flask and a teeny-tiny platen and chalice. </P> <P>In usage, the &quot;Eucharist&quot; usually refers to the whole service, and the *eating* of the Bread and Wine. The Bread and Wine themselves are referred to as &quot;the elements&quot;. Bread that is presented in the form of little white styrofoamesqe circles is called the Host (some churches use whole wheat hosts -- my warped sense of humour finds that funny). Any of the elements that are left over are, according to the rubrics in the 1662 prayerbook, to be &quot;reverently consumed&quot;. The cup is rinsed carefully in pure water, the crumbs off the platen (that's the plate that the bread was on) are brushed into the cup, and the minister drinks the rinsings. This part of the ablutions (that's the holy name for &quot;washing up&quot;) is done in church, either as soon as all the people have communicated, or right after the service. After the service, the cup and platen are then washed in a special sink that drains directly onto consecrated ground instead of into the sewers, so that any traces of the consecrated elements sink into consecrated ground. </P> <P>Hmmm...any other insider knowledge I've used here &lt;g&gt;... &quot;rubrics&quot; means the explanatory notes in the prayer-book, which were originally printed in red, hence &quot;rubric&quot;. The 1662 prayerbook is the basis of the Books of Common prayer used in all provinces of theAnglican Communion until 1979; at which time the Americans adopted a radical new Book of Common prayer. Everyone else is still using something that looks a lot like your 1928 prayer book; but most of us have alternate or supplementary service books that we use as well. The first prayer book was the 1549 prayer book; the differences between it and the 1662 have to do with an intervening religiously-motivated civil war in England. </P> <P>Anyone up for a game of trivial pursuit? I bomb on all the sports questions, I promise &lt;g&gt;. </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> </BODY> </HTML></ul></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
