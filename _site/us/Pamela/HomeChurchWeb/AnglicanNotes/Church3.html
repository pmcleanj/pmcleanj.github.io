<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">As I understand it if you are not Catholic
then you are protestant and if I am wrong what else is there? </FONT>
</P>
<P>The meaning of words drifts and becomes more complex with time.
&quot;Catholic&quot; and &quot;Protestant&quot; have been subject to
that &quot;semantic drift&quot;. 
</P>
<P>In pure usage, &quot;Catholic&quot; means &quot;all-encompassing&quot;,
and refers to the doctrine that *the* &quot;Church&quot; (which is
the &quot;Body of Christ&quot;) is the whole company of all Christian
People. This basic doctrine is held by many denominations beside the
Roman Catholic Church: Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, Lutherans, and
some Methodists and Presbyterians. The opposite of &quot;Catholic&quot;
in this pure usage isn't &quot;Protestant&quot;, but
&quot;Congregationalist&quot;. (Remember, I am using these terms to
refer to classic doctrines, not to denominations.) Congregationalism
is the doctrine that a single congregation can act alone and without
consensus with any other congregation, because a single individual
congregation experiences the completeness of the Body of Christ. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Protestant&quot; literally means &quot;someone who
protests&quot;, and refers to those who protested against the
findings of the Council of Trent, the council that claimed authority
over the whole church for the Pope. The &quot;protestants&quot; in
this sense were Catholics who were separated from the *Roman*
catholic church by the fact of their protest. 
</P>
<P>Martin Luther is a good example of a protestant. As you know, he
was a Roman Catholic priest. He didn't &quot;convert&quot; from Roman
Catholicism to protestantism, because protestantism hadn't been
invented yet. Rather, he saw his acts of *protest* as being
consistent with his calling as a *catholic*. The opposite of
&quot;protestant&quot; isn't &quot;catholic&quot;, but &quot;dogmatist&quot;
-- the belief that a Christian must accept the church hierarchy's
formulation of doctrine. &quot;Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia and Sola
Fidelis&quot; are Latin (&lt;g&gt; not Greek!&lt;g&gt;) for
&quot;Scripture Alone, Grace Alone, Faith Alone&quot;. They are the
slogan Luther chose to explain his position on the need -- or rather
the non-need -- for an organized Church hierarchy to formulate dogma
for the believer or to mediate between the believer and God. 
</P>
<P>Some congregationalists, for example some Baptists and some
Pentacostals, believe that the mediaeval catholic church was corrupt
long before the Council of Trent. They believe that their doctrine
and worship were preserved from the original first-century church,
and do not derive from Catholic practice in any way. Therefor, they
don't believe they are &quot;protestant&quot;, because *they*, being
completely separate from the Catholic church, were not involved in
any internal &quot;protests&quot; against the Roman Catholic
hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>Although many people nowadays use &quot;Catholic&quot; to mean
&quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot; and &quot;Protestant&quot; to mean
&quot;everybody else&quot;, the terms continue also to be used in
their older, more technical sense. 
</P>
<P>This is one of the differences that we are learning to accept
here. There are many Christians who, like you, hold preaching the
Holy Scripture , the Bible, to be the distinguishing point between
whether a form of worship is valid Christianity. This is, in fact,
consistent with the Muslim view of Christians: they call us a &quot;People
of the Book&quot; -- and see that as a good thing, a measure of our
acceptability. 
</P>
<P>My perspective -- the doctrine of my community -- is a little
different. I deeply love the Scripture. It is the witness of those
who knew Jesus, and of those who formed the Jewish world into which
Jesus was born. But I do *not* see Christians as a People of the
Book. We are a people of a living relationship. We are sent to *tell*
the Good News, not merely to hand out Bibles. We are a people of the
Witness, and the Bible is a beautiful, enduring witness to the Word,
but it is not the Word Himself, who was with God from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>So, like you, I feel as long as we love God and follow the one
true God then where we worship shouldn't matter as long as they
preach ... and here my different perspective kicks in ... the Word,
the living witness of Jesus Christ. But in my community, the Anglican
church, we generally take care not to confuse scripture with the
Word. It's a subtle distinction, and this complex community offers
the possibility to explore that distinction, with people like
yourself who bring a different viewpoint.
