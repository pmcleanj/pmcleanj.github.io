<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Can you please explain to me the actual
differences in BELIEF between the episcopal church and the catholic
church? Also, what are the episcopal church's views regarding
communion and confession? </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Episcopal church *is* catholic. It
is *also* &quot;protestant&quot;, in the sense that it not in
communion with Rome; that is it rejects or &quot;protests&quot;
Rome's false claims of authority. It is NOT &quot;congregationalist&quot;,
which is what most people mean when they say &quot;protestant&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The Roman Catholic Church believes that the Bishop of Rome has
absolute authority over all other Bishops. Anglicans (called
&quot;Episcopalians&quot; in the United States) believe that; except
for administrative matters such as budgets, synod processes, use of
national church resources and so on, which may be administered by an
Archbishop; each Bishop is directly responsible only to God for the
doctrinal and pastoral matters with which he deals. 
</P>
<P>That's the entire difference in belief in a nutshell. Many issues
fall out from that, however. We share with the Roman Catholic Church
those doctrines that are grounded in Scripture, Tradition, and the
common consensus of believers informed by the working of the Holy
Spirit. Other doctrines that exist in the Roman Catholic Church
solely by virtue of having been promulgated from Rome are not
universally accepted by Anglicans -- many are not accepted at all.
These include: 
</P>
<PRE> - the existence of purgatory. I know no Anglicans who believe
   in purgatory (and I know many Roman Catholics who don't!)
 - The Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. Some
   believe this, but many don't.
 - The bodily Assumption of the Blessed Virgin (ditto)
 - The infallibility of the Pope when speaking ex cathedra
   (or at any other time, for that matter)
 - Transubstantiation. This is a very technical doctrine. We
   do believe that the bread and wine are sacramentally 
   transformed in the Eucharist so that the communicant
   receives the Body and Blood of Christ. We don't however 
   claim to understand the nature of this transformation. 
   Transubstantiation is only one possibility;
   &quot;consubstantiation&quot; and &quot;Real Presence&quot; are alternate 
   explainations. Usually we accept it as a mystery, and just
   say &quot;His was the Word that spake it. He took the bread and
   brake it. And what His Word doth make it, I do believe and
   take it.&quot;
 - Rome's authority to canonize Saints. All Christian
   believers are &quot;saints&quot;. Saints worthy to be imitated, 
   invoked, or honoured are recognized by their reputation,
   not by paperwork performed by Rome. Anglicans would have
   no problem referring to Saint Theresa of Calcutta now,
   whereas her own denomination is still working her through
   the process.
 - Rome's authority to mandate moral teaching. Most priests
   and Bishops will offer counselling on issues like birth
   control, abortion, remarriage, homosexuality, tithing and
   charitable giving, vocations, and so on. But the final 
   moral choice is between you and God.</PRE><P>
Anglicans believe that the one true Church is Catholic -- that is,
&quot;universal&quot;. It exists in wholeness only when it includes
all Christian people in all times and places. (Interestingly, the
Roman Catholic church is *not* Catholic in this sense. It limits its
definition of &quot;Church&quot; to only those Christians who accept
the authority of Rome -- a sort of super-congregation within the
larger church) As catholics, we offer communion to all baptized
Christians. Some heterodox priests may offer communion to anyone,
baptized or not, who approaches the altar for communion, allowing God
to judge the person's heart. 
</P>
<P>Confession is offered on an as-needed basis. General Confession is
made at all Eucharists and most prayer services. Sacramental
confession can be made individually by appointment with the priest.
It is never required, but is always available and may in some
circumstances be recommended. Of this we say &quot;All may; some
should; none must&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Hope that helps.
