<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">I feel guilty, but when I do go to church, I
want to go alone, have some peace, get into my head. and not be real
social (not mean, just peaceful). I am more interested in the mental
aspects than the physical. I love to go early (me and the old folks)
and have a really nice mellow service.  </FONT>

<P>Contemplative worship is a well-respected tradition with strong
scriptural roots. Jesus himself went off into the wilderness, or up
onto the hillside to pray. Especially for introverts, contemplative
worship is a source of spiritual strength. It recharges one's
spiritual batteries. Noon-hour eucharists in the cathedral chapel,
6-a.m. Matins before work; evensong on the way home from the office:
these are luxuries that I miss now that they are no-longer available
to me given my schedule and changes in the offering of those
Services. Our beloved Matins and Evensong derive, in fact, from the
Daily Office of contemplative monastic communities. Cranmer's
intention in combining the eight traditional offices into three and
putting them in the BCP, was that every Christian should have a
*daily* pattern of contemplative prayer to sustain him through his
secular life. 
</P>
<P>The *error* in contemplative worship, is when it becomes a
replacement for the regular worship of the gathered Church. When the
whole Church gather for weekly worship, it is inherently *not*
contemplative. The Church includes emphesematic old men with rattling
coughs; wriggling excited two-year-olds; deaf grandmothers who say
&quot;Eh, Speak UP!&quot; in overmodulated stage whispers, teenagers
bubbling over with the love of life in 9/8 rock rhythms, Asperger's
and autism and Tourettes and dementia sufferers all doing their best
to keep their meds balanced and their behaviours acceptable, nursing
mothers and distracted fathers and fascinated five-year-olds saying
&quot;Mama, what did he *mean*&quot; throughout the sermon, the fat
lady who sings out of tune, a couple charismatics who shout &quot;Amen&quot;
while lifting Holy Hands, and a homeless drunk snoring on the back
pew. These *are* the church every bit as much as we well-bred and
well-dressed adults who can sing a-capella plain-chant and recite the
entire office from memory. 
</P>
<P>When a congregation decides to bar or shun those unaesthetic
elements of the church, it stops *being* the Church. When Christians
decide they will recharge their batteries at the contemplative
service and avoid contact with the fuller fellowship of the church,
they gradually choke themselves off from the Vine. It's obvious -- to
&quot;get&quot; without giving is outside of the Christian norm.
Remember, our Daily Offices come from the monastic pattern, but even
monastic communities that use daily contemplative worship to stoke
the fires of the spiritual life, still worship on Sunday with their
parish. What I suggested Trish on the previous board; of scheduling
sung Matins during the Sunday-School hour and then having the
Eucharist (possibly after coffee) for the whole community together is
a traditionally correct way to meet both needs, well adapted for
modern schedules. The combination of the two services is actually
suggested in the rubrics of the traditional (1662) Book of Common
Prayer. Karen's method of noon-hour worship is another; I try to get
up early enough to recite Morning Prayer before breakfast which is
yet a third option. 
</P>
<P>Contemplative worship sets prayer before God like an offering of
incense. The gathering of the Church is celebratory, a bubbling over
of the Spirit; full measure, pressed down, running over. A full
Christian life needs both.
