<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">When you think of the word &quot;works&quot;
in a Christian context...</FONT></P>
<P>...what are you thinking about? <FONT COLOR="#280099">? </FONT>
</P>
<P>&quot;Works&quot; is the watershed, between two facets of our
relationship with God ...</P>
<P>Call it them the &quot;responsive&quot; and &quot;receptive&quot;
components of relationship. Human relationships have these two
facets, too. We &quot;love&quot; our children when we put food on
their table, provide their clothes, tend their wounds, nurture their
spirits. But our love is complete when we also receive their gifts,
hear their encouragement, and enjoy their compassion. 
</P>
<P>Or, call them the &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot;
components of relationship: accepting, hearing and enjoying are
entirely subjective actions that only the actor experiences. They are
pleasant experiences, even transcendent. But they are only half of a
relationship that becomes complete when the actor responds. Giving,
speaking and caring are objective actions; fulfilling the actor's
basic need to communicate, to reach out and affect the Other to whom
he relates. 
</P>
<P>God's Chosen People are given a list of active behaviours -- the
Torah. By fulfilling all the requirements of the Law, one reaches out
to God in communication, in an effort to please and affect God. But
that is not sufficient (and I am not bashing Judaism here, either;
spiritual Jews will say something similar). The relationship with God
becomes complete when one also receives, accepts, hears, and enjoys
God subjectively. 
</P>
<P>Those who are born again in Christ have experienced internally
God's love and gift of salvation, and hear his voice speaking in
their hearts. But that is not sufficient, either. Until we respond by
reaching out to God objectively, as God's hands and feet in the world
and in the service of our fellow men, our relationship with God is
only half-consummated. 
</P>
<P>Confession and head-covering seem like pretty wimpy responses to
Transcendent Love. But, if it is a response that flows from the
heart, it's valid. Starting a prison ministry is good, but if it
doesn't spring from (or result in) subjective experience of God, it
is hollow. 
</P>
<P>Salvation is salvation. Works have nothing to do with salvation,
for truly &quot;We are not saved by works but by faith.&quot; But
whatever happens to us after death, salvation in this life is lived
the context of a relationship with God. A relationship requires
action. &quot;Faith without works is dead&quot;.
