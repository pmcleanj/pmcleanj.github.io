<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This Thursday evening is exactly half a
year from or to Christmas, and is The Nativity of Saint John the
Baptist. It is a red-letter day, meaning that, in the words of the
Prayer Book, it is &quot;appointed to be observed&quot;. It is
sufficiently important a feast in the Church year to have an Octave
appointed for its celebration -- eight days, instead of just one. The
only other feasts to have Octaves (besides Easter, which has &quot;a
week of weeks&quot;, and Christmas that has an octave-and-a-half) are
Epiphany, the feast of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and All Saints. 
</P>
<P>Despite its being &quot;appointed to be observed&quot;, none of
the churches in my city are planning services for St. John's Eve.
Tentatively, I'm planning to celegrate with a cook-out on a hill-top
in a local natural area (at the permanent fireplace in the area, with
minimal ecological impact.) Saint John's Eve is of course one of the
Quarter Days, aproximately located at the Summer equinox. Bon-fires
are part of the traditional celebration of the day. One good use of a
Saint-John's Eve bonfire is to burn all the school-papers from the
preceding school year that are not &quot;keepers&quot;. Give thanks
for education, and symbolically offer your education as a sacrifice
to be used in God's service. Here's the collect for Schools and
Colleges: 
</P>
<P>Almighty God, of whose only gift cometh wisdom and understanding:
We beseech thee with thy gracious favour to behold our universities,
colleges, and schools, that knowledge may be increased among us, and
all good learning flourish and abound. Bless all who teech and all
who learn; and grant that in humility of heart they may ever look
unto thee, who art the fountain of all wisdom; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. Amen. 
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It was pouring rain on Saint John's
Eve, with the occasional thunder and lightening. Rachel listened
askance to my bonfire/feast proposal, and suggested that we use the
little iron stove in the parlour. Anne wanted the hill-top. They
compromised on the backyard, where we could shelter under the eaves
of the garage, but still have a decent fire. 
</P>
<P>We cooked bannock on a stick, with rashers of bacon wrapped round
the bannock, and had strawberries, whipped cream, and carbonated
raspberry juice. For table-grace we prayed: 
</P>
<P>&quot;Almighty God, by whose providence thy servant John Baptist
was wonderfully born, and sent to prepare the way of thy Son our
Saviour, by preaching of repentance: Make us so to follow his
doctrine and holy life, that we may truly repent according to his
preaching, and after his example constantly speak the truth, boldly
rebuke vice, and patiently suffer for the truth's sake; through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.&quot; 
</P>
<P>It was a good feast, if rather damp!</P>
