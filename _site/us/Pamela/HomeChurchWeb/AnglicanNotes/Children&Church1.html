<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">My church has Sunday School before the
service. I hate this because we live half an hour away and this would
mean leaving home at 8:30and not leaving until 1:00! Why doesn't it
at least overlap with the service? Why is it the trend now to have it
not overlap with the service? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>I haven't seen that trend -- Alas! 
</P>
<P>I had to leave the Anglican church to provide that experience for
my children. We have an extra half hour, though: Sunday School
doesn't start until 9:15 and it only takes 15 minutes to drive there.
Still, going from my experience, you probably wouldn't get any exta
sleep anyway: I can't get my children to stay in bed for the extra
half hour &lt;g&gt;! 
</P>
<P>In fact, I've seen just the reverse trend, that churches like the
Evangelical Missionary Brethren, the Lutherans and Roman Catholics
who have hitherto preserved the custom of gathering the whole Church
for worship, are now introducing Sunday School or childcare during
Worship. I am very disappointed, I would have hoped that they learn
from our experience. 
</P>
<P>The Anglican churches in the developed world have a significant
retention problem with cradle Anglicans, manifesting typically in the
teens. Having never had a place in the worship of the Church, teens
who are finished with Sunday School or who are leaving home for
college, generally leave the church behind as well. Statistical
evidence shows that children are much more likely to be regular
committed Christians as adults, if they have been fully involved in
the weekly worship of the Church as children. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, it is the capital-T tradition of the church that
children should be *brought to worship*, not involved in some
alternative activity that keeps them *out of worship*. Quoting from
the Book of Common Prayer (the old one, so whether we're Canadian or
British or American we have the same Tradition in &quot;Common&quot;
&lt;g&gt;) at Baptism parents and sponsors are charged to &quot;bring
him to take his part in public worship&quot;. In the Catechism
children answer &quot;What is your work as a lay member of the Church
of God?&quot; with &quot;To take my part in its worship&hellip;&quot;
Note that the BCP mandates catechetical instruction and examination
to take place &quot;open in the church&hellip;at Morning or Evening
Prayer&quot;. From my readings of books published in the last two
centuries, it is apparent that participation in worship was the norm
for children as well as adults until well into the 20th century. In
fact, from Reginald Bibby's demographic research in &quot;Fragmented
Gods&quot;, it's possible to correlate the decline in membership in
the Anglican church with the introduction of Sunday School as an
alternative to worship (there are other correlations, too -- World
War II is the biggie). 
</P>
<P>Finally, scheduling Sunday School outside of worship time is true
to our understanding of the Christian calling. If study is important,
it is important to adults too. If worship is important, it is
important to children too. If worship is an integral whole, it is an
integral whole for everyone. The challenge to liturgical planners is
to find ways to meet children's needs for full inclusion and the
Church's need for integrity, and also meet the needs of parents with
tight schedules and of those adults whose contemplative needs aren't
satisfied by Daily Prayer. But sacrificing integrity or inclusivity,
although it has been the practice of the last 50 to 70 years, is not
a solution. 
</P>
<P>Some churches have gone to offering Church School on a different
day entirely - I like this idea. Many sandwich Sunday School for all
ages between two services (typically providing a choice of Rite I and
Rite II). One has Sunday School *in Church* -- children sit with
their classes in worship and it's the teachers' job to help them
focus on the liturgy. This was a very child-friendly church where the
whole congregation recognized their corporate responsibility for
&quot;our&quot; children and didn't feel they were the parents'
problem. Not coincidentally, many latch-key children from the local
inner-city neighbourhood came to worship alone to bask in the love
and acceptance they felt there! A couple churches I know - not
Anglican, though -- have a congregational lunch after the service,
and then have Sunday School in the afternoon. After all, we have
nothing to do on the Lord's Day that's more important than worship,
fellowship, and the study of God's Word, right&lt;g&gt;?. 
</P>
<P>Your church probably has a Worship and Ministry committee, or some
such thing. Perhaps you could meet with them to brainstorm ways of
meeting your need. If you come up with a devout, theologically sound
solution that works very well, please share it with us!
