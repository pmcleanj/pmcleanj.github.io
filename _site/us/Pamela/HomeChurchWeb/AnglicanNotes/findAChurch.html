suggestions on how to search out more &quot;liberal and all inclusive
Episcoplal parishes? </B></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Personally, I recommend the telephone
survey...</P>
<P>'Phone all the Episcopalian churches in your region, (circling
outward from the most convenient location) and ask a set of loaded
open-ended questions. Keep good notes of the answers, 'cause by the
time you've interviewed staff at twenty churches, you'll be a whole
lot more skilled at interpreting the answers. I don't recommend
identifying yourself in the process, because you can't be sure which
ones are, figuratively speaking of course, the heretic-burning kind. 
</P>
<P>For example: &quot;Please tell me about your social outreach
programme....Who chairs the outreach committee and can I contact
her?&quot; Or &quot;In particular, how do you accomodate ministry
opportunities for working single mothers?&quot; Or, &quot;I'm looking
for a church community where a homosexual can feel welcome&quot; --
(Oh, do that one! I want to hear about the answers you get!!!) 
</P>
<P>Alternately, wangle an introduction to the Bishop's personal
secretary. Diocesan staff tend to be among the more liberal members
of the diocese, but if they *are* stuffy, go visit the church they
complain about the most. Otherwise, take her advice. 
</P>
<P>Or, find out where the local Integrity chapter meets (they usually
meet in the evening in a host church, but obviously the host church
will *not* be the rigid right-wing kind. 
</P>
<P>Welcome to the board. Keep us posted.
