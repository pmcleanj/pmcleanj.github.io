<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Quick question ... or maybe not so quick
depending on the answer. I've finally started going back to church
after many years away. What are the different colors for the
different seasons? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Easy! Generally White for rejoicing, Purple for penitence, Red for
Saints, Green for ordinary time ...</P>
<P>but these are not engraved in stone anywhere, and local custom
dictates interesting variations. Ancient tradition also shows
considerable variation. 
</P>
<P>Advent - Purple, but under the influence of liturgical reform a
preference is growing for Blue. 
</P>
<P>Christmas (until 6 January) White, but Gold is equally acceptable.
Usually paraments are white embroidered with gold. 
</P>
<P>Epiphany, and the weeks preceeding Lent -- Green. 
</P>
<P>Lent (except passion week) -- Purple, but Ash Wednesday paraments
may be black. Good Friday would be black too, but usually the altar
is stripped on Maundy and no paraments whatsoever are used. 
</P>
<P>Passion week (the Sunday before Easter until Maundy Thursday) --
Red 
</P>
<P>Easter (fifty days until Pentecost) White and Gold. 
</P>
<P>Day of Pentecost -- Red 
</P>
<P>Season of Pentecost -- Green 
</P>
<P>Individual Saints days are red for martyred saints and white for
unmartyred saints. Weddings and baptisms are white and gold.
