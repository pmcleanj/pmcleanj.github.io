<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I grew up in the
Baptist church and married my Episcopalian husband. I like our church
and respect our Priest. Needless to say, I was in culture shock at
first, but have really enjoyed learning about the church's beliefs. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">We are having a baby in August and I had a
few questions. First, what does the dedication mean in the church?
Does that mean that the baby is Christian at that point, or does it
mean that we are &quot;dedicated&quot; to helping this baby find a
relationship with Christ? Why is it done so early (in the first month
at our church)in the child's life instead of when the child can
understand what's going on? </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Brace yourself for more culture shock! We don't &quot;dedicate&quot;
babies. We *baptise* them. Dedication ceremonies are something
adopted by those churches who don't practice infant baptism but
recognise that parents have a natural urge to celebrate their babies
birth in some special way with their spiritual community (and it
gives them a chance to use that antique christening gown without
compromising their beliefs by having an actual christening). 
</P>
<P>&quot;Christening&quot; is an old-fashioned word for &quot;baptism&quot;.
Unlike the Baptist belief that Baptism *follows* conversion, we
believe that Baptism is part of the *process* of conversion. We
believe that *God* takes action in baptism, and that this is the
means by which a person is adopted into God's family - we become &quot;His
by adoption and grace&quot;. At the moment of his baptism, your child
is received into the household of god, and shares with us in His
eternal priesthood. In short, yes, he's a Christian -- your little
brother, as well as your son. 
</P>
<P>We baptise infants for three basic reasons. 
</P>
<P>First, it is appropriate to the nature of the sacrament. Since it
is God that is acting, our competence and understanding are
irrelevant. We are no more fit to influence God's actions than is a
new-born babe; so there is no reason not to baptise a new-born babe. 
</P>
<P>Second, it is scriptural. Scripturally, there is no explicit
reference to baptising infants, but neither is there any specific
reference to infants being excluded when someone was baptised &quot;him
and all his household&quot;. You can bet those households included
infants - remember that servants, slaves and extended family were all
part of a New-Testament era household, and that birth-control hadn't
been invented yet. And the actual word in Scripture is *all*, not
&quot;all except a few&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Third, it is the unbroken practice of the Church. Since there has
been no time in the available post-Apostolic record that infant
baptism has not been an accepted practice, and since the evidence of
the Apostolic record in Acts is that it was practiced, we have no
reason to believe that infant baptism was ever rejected by the
church. 
</P>
<P>The norm for baptism is still the baptism by full immersion of
adult converts. Full immersion is a powerful symbol - and, my
dramatic sense as a liturgist forces me to emphasise, a desirable
symbol. But immersion is not essential; if it were we could not
baptise converts in the Sahara during time of drought, for example.
Where necessary baptism by pouring water on the catechumen's head has
always been allowed, although immersion is preferred. Regrettably,
immersion is so immensely less convenient, that many catholic
Christians have never witnessed baptism by immersion and aren't even
aware that it is the normative practice. (Normative doesn't mean
usual, it means the most proper standard of practice from which all
other practices are derived). Ancient and mediaeval churches have
lovely baptisteries that illustrate that norm for us modern
Christians. Even Saint Paul's in London, which is a relatively late
construction, has a baptismal font that you could drown a baby
elephant in &lt;g&gt;. Don't know if they ever use it now, though.
The Reverend Sally Boyles (whom I know from her earlier ministery in
my city) at her church in Toronto is said to baptise babies by full
immersion (swooshing their little heads quickly through the water so
they don't choke, I presume), just as is normative for adult
converts. 
</P>
<P>Your child, however, will never have the experience of being an
adult convert. That is a fact. He will grow in understanding of the
faith and in the love of God because those are the essence of his
home; he will be steeped in them from his first breath. To pretend
that the step from childish faith to adult faith is a conversion is
quite a stretch. Take it from an adult convert - I was raised
athiest. Infant baptism recognizes your child's reality as adult
baptism recognised my reality. When your child is ready to take up
his own lay ministry as an adult believer, it will be appropriate for
him to seek Confirmation. The Bishop will lay hands on his head and
pray for an increase of the Holy Spirit in his life. That is how we
recognise the still-significant step from childish faith to adult
witness.
