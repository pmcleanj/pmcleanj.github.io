<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Can you tell me what ECUSA is and what the
revised common lectionary? We are in Confirmation classes now, but
wow...there is alot to learn. Also...you go to a Lutheran church
right now, am I right or confused? Is there much of a difference in
Episcopal and Lutheran? </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Boy, you sure pack some big questions into a small post&lt;g&gt;!</P>
<P>ECUSA is &quot;The Episcopal Church of the United States of
America&quot;, which is what it's usually called but is not its full
legal name. It's properly &quot;PECUSA&quot;, which is the
&quot;Protestant Episcopal et cetera&quot;. 
</P>
<P>The Revised Common Lectionary is a system for reading the Bible at
the main Sunday service. Using a prescribed cycle of readings (&quot;the
lectionary&quot;) at worship is an Anglican principle, addressed in
one of the historic prefaces -- it means that everyone in the
communion is assured of being exposed to a broad overview of
Scripture rather than just the rector's favourite readings; and that
everyone gets the same readings at appropriate times, when the
activities of the Church year most reinforce them and they can most
inform our activities. The Common Lectionary was an ecumenical
endeavor to put all the liturgical churches on the same page. Roman
Catholics and Lutherans use a lectionary too; and with the ecumenical
dialogue of the reforming 60's, and people attending one another's
churches and sharing ministry, it made sense to be able to discuss
&quot;this Sunday's readings&quot; with one another regardless of
denominational affiliation. Also, since the lectionary has a flow
from Sunday to Sunday, having a common lectionary means I can go to
the Lutheran church this Sunday and the Episcopalian church the next,
and not feel like I came in in the middle of the story. 
</P>
<P>The main differences between the Common Lectionary and the
historic Anglican lectionary are: 
</P>
<PRE>- addition of an Old Testament reading (we used just to
  have the Epistle and the Gospel)
- a three-year cycle of readings instead of a one-year cycle
- harmonization of the Psalter with the readings</PRE><P>
The Common Lectionary took a more-or-less sequential read through the
Gospels, and selected Epistle, Psalm and Old Testament readings that
illustrated the Gospel principle. That meant, however, that you never
got a good sequential read through any of the old testament's great
stories. There were other wrinkles to be worked out too, hence the
*Revised* Common Lectionary. The RCL gives you the option of two Old
Testament readings: one sequential, one illustrating the Gospel
principles; and two Psalms corresponding to the two Old Testament
readings. 
</P>
<P>The Lutheran church is a reformed Catholic church, just as is the
Anglican church. It is informed by German culture in the way that the
Anglican church is informed by Anglo-Saxon and Celtic culture, so
it's music tends to the German hymn-tunes; the liturgical settings
are different, and the wording of the liturgy is slightly different
(and their words of reception for the newly Baptized are the *WORST
EVER* piece of liturgical English I have ever read!) Luther made more
of a stamp on his church than the Anglican reformers made on theirs,
was more of an individualist, and was more concious of being in
schism from Rome; so you often hear Lutherans quoting Luther. I don't
think I've ever heard an Anglican quote Cranmer except in an academic
setting. Luther was a prolific and powerful writer; and his personal
theology tend to inform the Lutheran church and give it a bit of a
bias. 
</P>
<P>Luther's battle-cry against Rome was &quot;Sola Gratia, Sola
Fidelis, Sola Scriptura&quot; -- so you find less reliance on
Tradition and Reason and a correspondingly heavier weighting on
Scripture than in the Anglican communion. But overall, Lutherans have
the same theology and practice (and breadth of practice) as Anglicans
with two heterodox exceptions. The exceptions are 
</P>
<P>1) The Lutheran church has not, or maybe has not, or maybe doesn't
want to, or maybe has a different understanding of, *Apostolic
Succession*. This is the idea that each Bishop is consecrated by a
preceeding Bishop in unbroken chain back to the Apostles. Lutherans
have temporary Bishops who go back to being ordinary guys when their
five-year term is up. This was the sticking-point on the Common Call
to Ministry: Apostolic Succession is very important in the Anglican
understanding of Sacrament. 
</P>
<P>2) Lutherans teach that, in the absence of an ordained minister, a
layperson can consecrate the Eucharist. This is related to the first
heterodoxy: if Bishops are just an administrative function, and
priests get their authority from the Bishop so they're nobody special
either, then the authority to consecrate the Eucharist is just an
administrative function too. And since Lutherans believe that the
Real Presence is only present in the Elements during the actual
Eucharist, it's accepted practice to toss the leftovers in the trash.
It's very hard for me to type this -- I'm a practical modern rational
scientist; but I become physically ill at the thought of the
Eucharist being abused in this way. Their theology *is* sound, the
world *won't* end due to different communion practices, and God
*does* transcend -- and sanctify -- even the trashbin in which the
uneaten Bread is placed. But I can't bear it: I never go down to tea
after service on Communion Sundays for fear I will see something that
I would rather be blind to. Incidentally, the teaching flowing out of
the Common Call to Ministry is also addressing this conflict.

<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">OK...then answer me this...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">What is done with our Eucharist? Is it all
consumed? I know my SIL who is Catholic says all of their wine is
consumed, but I never asked her about the Eucharist. Also, I that the
&quot;Protestant&quot; part of the name was dropped. I wonder why,
anybody know? </FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
&quot;Protestant&quot; thing came up last week on my liturgy e-list.,
</FONT></SPAN>a list mostly frequented by Lutheran pastors, with a
fair sprinkling of episcopals, RCD's and orthodox. &quot;Protestant&quot;
is still part of the legal name of the national synod, but the
constitution was recently changed to allow &quot;ECUSA&quot; and &quot;the
Episcopal Church&quot; to be used in official documents. The person
who brought it up on the e-list reprinted the revised preamble of the
constitution, but unfortunately I deleted it. 
</P>
<P>Any leftover sacrament that isn't consumed is kept in a special
container in the sanctuary called a &quot;tabernacle&quot;, that has
a light hanging over it whenever the Reserve Sacramant is in the
tabernacle. The light over it is sometimes called the &quot;Presence
Lamp&quot;. It's a &quot;high church&quot; custom, and some churches
(those that take pride in being &quot;low church&quot; or
&quot;evangelical&quot;) consider it an excessively &quot;papist&quot;
custom. The bread and wine stored in the tabernacle is called the
&quot;Reserved Sacramant&quot;. When the priest or your parish
visitation ministers goes visiting, they put the reserved sacrament
in a special little box, often silver, called a &quot;Pix&quot;.
(There was a horror movie a while ago called &quot;The Pix&quot; -- I
didn't see the movie but I presume that's what it about. Hollywood
has a fascination with catholic religiosity.) Presumably there's a
special name for the little flask too, but I don't know it. A pix is
a traditional gift for an ordinand -- they usually come in a set with
the flask and a teeny-tiny platen and chalice. 
</P>
<P>In usage, the &quot;Eucharist&quot; usually refers to the whole
service, and the *eating* of the Bread and Wine. The Bread and Wine
themselves are referred to as &quot;the elements&quot;. Bread that is
presented in the form of little white styrofoamesqe circles is called
the Host (some churches use whole wheat hosts -- my warped sense of
humour finds that funny). Any of the elements that are left over are,
according to the rubrics in the 1662 prayerbook, to be &quot;reverently
consumed&quot;. The cup is rinsed carefully in pure water, the crumbs
off the platen (that's the plate that the bread was on) are brushed
into the cup, and the minister drinks the rinsings. This part of the
ablutions (that's the holy name for &quot;washing up&quot;) is done
in church, either as soon as all the people have communicated, or
right after the service. After the service, the cup and platen are
then washed in a special sink  that drains directly onto consecrated
ground instead of into the sewers, so that any traces of the
consecrated elements sink into consecrated ground. 
</P>
<P>Hmmm...any other insider knowledge I've used here &lt;g&gt;...
&quot;rubrics&quot; means the explanatory notes in the prayer-book,
which were originally printed in red, hence &quot;rubric&quot;. The
1662 prayerbook is the basis of the Books of Common prayer used in
all provinces of theAnglican Communion until 1979; at which time the
Americans adopted a radical new Book of Common prayer. Everyone else
is still using something that looks a lot like your 1928 prayer book;
but most of us have alternate or supplementary service books that we
use as well. The first prayer book was the 1549 prayer book; the
differences between it and the 1662 have to do with an intervening
religiously-motivated civil war in England. 
</P>
<P>Anyone up for a game of trivial pursuit? I bomb on all the sports
questions, I promise &lt;g&gt;.
