<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">There's been a lot of concern over Harry
Potter books in school...(m)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">My son goes to a Christian school and they
are not allowed to read or do a book report on Harry Potter this
year. I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or
have your children read Harry Potter and you find there's really not
anything wrong with it? My son isn't upset about it and neither am I
- I guess I am just curious what's in the books. </FONT>

<P>My nursery bookshelves contain many other equally-imaginative (and
better-written) children's fantasies....</P>
<P>Although Rowling's books stand up pretty well among them, in terms
of both the quality of the language and the morality of the
underlying themes, I prefer E. Nesbitt's charming fantasies, and for
that matter Mary Norton's and Alan Garner's. So does Anne (my DD8). 
</P>
<P>BUT, even a child likes to be able to discuss what she's reading
with her peers, and most of them have never heard of a Psammead. Anne
became interested in Harry Potter when her cronies did. One of them
gave her the first two books for her birthday, and Anne was won over.
I wasn't: I read all four Harry Potter books. While they strained my
suspension of disbelief and pushed my hot buttons regarding cultural
assumptions about educational norms, I found them morally
unobjectionable. 
</P>
<P>What finally won me over to the fans of Harry Potter, was an event
that occurred recently at Anne's school. She had gotten into a spat
with an unpopular child -- a child whom Anne had been asked to
befriend by both me and her headmistress. Anne had been feeling the
strain of standing up for &quot;Joe&quot; against her close friends
who wanted to shun him. I was expressing sympathy with her, when she
interrupted me and fetched &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, saying that
she wanted to read me something. Here's what she read (I am
paraphrasing from memory): &quot;Today, a we lost one of our own.
Remember Cedric Diggory! Remember Cedric whenever you are tempted to
do what is easy instead of what is right&quot;. I asked her what that
meant -- what she planned to do; and she told me she intended to go
on being &quot;Joe's&quot; friend. 
</P>
<P>Jesus told us, &quot;by their fruits you may know them&quot;.
Harry Potter is teaching Anne to choose what is *right* over what is
*easy* -- that is the &quot;fruit&quot; of these stories.
