<P>t is tough. I would be inclined to go even farther with the
religious tolerance theme...</P>
<P>and at the same time introduce a degree of religious judgement. 
</P>
<P>Here's what I mean: 
</P>
<P>Do you have close friends who are non-Christians, whose religious
practice is very different from yours, even if it's just obviously
lacking? Capture the teachable moments to discuss what beliefs and
doctrines the differences are based on. We have Muslim colleagues,
and both my children attended a Muslim funeral and occasionally sing
&quot;Allah hummah, salah Allah&quot; ever since (I think that means
&quot;there is no God but God&quot; and I have no idea if I got the
spelling right &lt;g&gt;). Three of their aunties are Witches -- one
in an open Coven, one Solitary, one a Kitchen Witch. Grandma and
Grampa are essentially puritans, we're essentially catholic, Tante
and Ohm are atheist. There's a Jewish family and a Buddhist family at
their school. So they've had pretty sophisticated comparative
religion discussions, even as young as 5. Two books that help are
Peter Spier's &quot;People&quot; and &quot;What I Believe&quot; by
Alan Brown and Andrew Langley. 
</P>
<P>One idea we talk about, is that some people think there's only one
way to worship God, and only one way to understand God, and that
people who worship differently are evil and are going to Hell. (One
thing I dislike about the transition from Anglican to Lutheran
worship is that the children are now well acquainted with
descriptions of sin and hell). I've asked the girls to consider
whether they think Auntie Tammy is evil, and whether they think our
loving heavenly Father would send Auntie Tammy to hell. Okay, it's a
slanted question, but it makes the point. Then I say that, while
those people are allowed to think *we're* wrong to worship as we do,
we're allowed to think *they're* wrong to say God will punish good
people. 
</P>
<P>And I think I would also point out that, with so many things to
*agree* on, we would be wise not to discuss God, worship, and heaven
with people who disagree so strongly. 
</P>
<P>Good luck. Hope you find a solution that works. Children shouldn't
have this kind of problem.
