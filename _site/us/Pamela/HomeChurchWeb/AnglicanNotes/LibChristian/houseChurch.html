<P>Out of the mouths of Babes...</P>
<P>We tried the house-church idea, too. It has some real strengths.
These are some of the things that made it work for us: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> - involve at least one more family if you can. </PRE><P>
Church is about community. Community stretches us and smooths off our
rough spots, giving us something to sound out our insights against
and round out our relevation. When God reveals godself directly, God
reveals different aspects to different individuals. You can't get the
whole picture on your own. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> - Use the liturgy</PRE><P>
That's what you crave, after all. One of the old prefaces to the BCP
calls it &quot;the priceless possession of the church&quot;. The
church is the people, not the institution, so the people should claim
it and use it. Get your own if you don't have one already. Use the
1928 or older if that's what you want. Customize for your communities
needs (use Latin!). Print out your customized liturgy so that
everyone can follow. Use consistency from week to week to build
traditions and so that the children can follow. Collect an offering
for a chosen charity. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> - Add the &quot;smells and bells&quot;</PRE><P>
Cover the dining-room table or coffee table with white linen. Light
candles (even light one for every person in the room!). Have music --
haul out the old guitar or tin whistle from your college residence
days or recruit a pianist, even sing along with a tape if you don't
have any musical talent. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> - Include everyone, accomodate personal needs</PRE><P>
Stop and explain things to children or catechumens. Make sure
everyone has a comfortable chair, whether their legs are short or
their back is weak. Let the children lead songs and/or light candles.
Take turns with others to plan the liturgy, lead the prayers of the
people, and preach a homily. 
</P>
<P>When we started, we explained to Rachel what we were doing (she
was just turned 3) and she asked &quot;But Mama, who will give us the
bread?&quot; In the end, that's why House Church didn't meet our
needs. If you have any channel by which you can access the
preconsecrated elements, you can use that to maintain a sense of
connectedness with the larger church. My experience is that the
Priests of the institutional church will not allow that leverage --
of being able to withhold the Eucharist -- to pass from their hands.
