<P>Skewed views on my right-wing bible study: What is a parable?</P>
<P>We were reading from Matthew 13:3-23 week before last: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> <A HREF="http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Mat/Mat013.html#top">http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Mat/Mat013.html#top</A></PRE><P>
Now, we generally treat &quot;parables&quot; as fables: simple
stories illustrating a religious or moral lesson. Bible &quot;studies&quot;
frequently limit their depth of engagement with a parable to simply
restating the &quot;moral&quot; of the story, in this case &quot;If
you have no spiritual depth you can't bear fruit&quot; or something
like that. 
</P>
<P>Bhuddism also uses short, simple stories as a teaching tool. They
are called &quot;koans&quot;
(<A HREF="http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/KoanStudy.html#Definitions">http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/KoanStudy.html#Definitions</A>,
and some examples:
<A HREF="http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/Koans-PYL.html#01">http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVLPages/ZenPages/Koans-PYL.html#01</A>).
</P>
<P>What if Jesus' parables are themselves not so much *fables*, as
*koans*? Remember, the Holy Land cultures are essentially *eastern*
cultures. The east is notably less anal than the Roman-influenced
west about issues of control, authority, and right-wrong duality.
Could there be to the parables something more -- and subtler -- than
the simplistic reading-out of them that Matthew reduces them to in
vv19-23? According to my Oxford Study bible, vv19-23 is probably a
late addition to the text and the work of the evangelist, and not at
all the actual quoted words of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>After all, the disciples would have had to be dolts not to come up
with the simplistic reduction Matthew proposes for themselves. *They*
seemed to be looking for something deeper. We've seen in the last
several months how much more we learn from struggling with the hard
questions of our faith than we learn from &quot;finding&quot; the
&quot;answers&quot;. Now, can we play with this a bit? If the simple
(obtuse) explaination is veiling Jesus' subtler intent in this
parable, what glimpses of other meaning here can we share? 
</P>

<P>I can easily see the disciples (who, as I say, seemed a pretty
doltish group) trying to deconstruct Jesus' words to find some
esoteric meaning that would make them the &quot;ones in the know&quot;
and everyone else the unenlightened. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Hmmm. I frequently impune the disciples' intellect, but I hadn't
considered their *motivations* for doltishness...</P>
<P>You may very well be right. A recurring theme of the Gospels *is*
Jesus' being expected to be something different than he was. And the
greater part of his discourses is clear, concrete, and
straightforward. The parables seem less so, especially the &quot;the
Kingdom of Heaven is like...&quot; ones. 
</P>
<P>A fundamental difference between gnosticism and mysticism is the
exclusivity you speak of. Another difference is the nature of the
secret &quot;knowledge&quot;. Gnosis is just that -- knowledge, a
head-awareness of some secret set of facts or codes. Mysticism is
more about communicating a non-verbal knowledge. Gnosis is *given*
from the insider to the inductee. Mystic knowledge is discovered by
the seeker herself, and the teacher can only point the way. Gnosis is
closely guarded and the insiders try *not* to communicate it; mystic
knowledge is subtle and elusive even though the teacher *strives* to
communicate it. 
</P>
<P>Jesus may well have had a mystic subtext, without ever intending
the secret-society mentality that Matthew suggests. Certainly
*Bhudda's* message of enlightenment was inclusive and egalitarian,
being directly counter to his native caste-system; so &quot;mystic&quot;
teaching isn't inherently exclusive. 
</P>
<P>But here's part II of my Bible-Study-eviction-risking speculation:
What if Jesus *didn't* turn the water in to wine? The Gospel
*doesn't* say that he did! It says Mary said, the servants said,
Jesus said, the servants did, the steward said.
<A HREF="http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Jhn/Jhn002.html">http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Jhn/Jhn002.html</A>
(This is one of the few passages that reads unequivocally as a true
eye-witness account, since it requires no inside knowledge on the
part of the narrator). There is a Zen-like message in the steward of
a great feast tasting the pure taste of clear water and proclaiming
it to be better than wine. There is a message of simplicity and
right-focus in the Lord saying, de-facto, &quot;if you're out of
wine, make do with what you have; it's the company that matters not
the material goods that you're showing off with.&quot; Interesting
too, the evangelist *doesn't* call this a miracle (although the
translaters do); he calls it a &quot;sign&quot; -- which could mean
an indicator of the kind of gospel Jesus was proclaiming. I see a
consistency between *this* interpretation, and Jesus' much later
famous (infamous) &quot;Martha, Martha, you are busy with so many
things...&quot; speach. Pure random speculation, of course, and the
sort of thing you definately don't float in front of a relatively
conservative Bible Study group.
