<P>Quick answer...</P>
<P>&quot;Christian Education hour&quot; is Sunday School. It's pretty
odd for an Anglican church to have this at a separate time, but it
bodes well for not being shunned in the actual service for the crime
of bringing a child. It also suggests that what they refer to as
&quot;Sunday School&quot; is really just childcare, which is what I
always suspected anyhow. Anyway, better to skip it, although that
might be where the juice and cookies are. 
</P>
<P>&quot;Said Communion&quot;, &quot;Contemporary Eucharist&quot;,
and &quot;Choral Eucharist&quot; are three flavours of the same
thing. Pick one. Said is for devout people trying to get to church
before going hiking; Contemporary is for people who like to clap and
tap their feet, Choral is for contemplative fogeys like Janet and me.
</P>
<P>If you're trying to pass as Anglican, don't sit too far forward.
But, I'd pick the second row that actually has people in it. There's
lot's of action to see and short people miss it if they're at the
back. There's also a lot of audience participation, which is why you
need an old hand sitting in front of you to copy. $5. in the pot is
acceptable, although non-conformists like me don't put in anything
except on the week I get paid, and no-one ever complains; just pass
the plate on to the next person as though you were passing the
potatos and didn't care for any yourself. Dress as for the school or
office; I take it this is a Sherwood Forest church -- highly suburban
but laid back, some people might dress up but as long as you wear
shoes no-one will notice your clothes. 
</P>
<P>Don't take communion (you had probably guessed). If you can enlist
a native guide at the door, that's best, as following the service is
cryptic. Listen to the priest and read the bulletin. 
</P>
<P>Gotta run, so not proof-reading this (sorry) but I thought some
sort of response might be urgent.

<P>Just a comment about the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;...</P>
<P>Higgs is in the U.S., where stuff is a little different. You will
find a bunch of books in a rack on the pew in front of you. One will
be a thick small maroon book in Elizabethan English called the Book
of Common Prayer. It's like the script for the traditional services
(the Choral Eucharist will probably use it; turn to page 67). The
slightly larger green book, the Book of Alternative Services, is the
same thing for Contemporary services. The bulletin will tell you
which book to use and what pages to turn to; the friendly native
guide will have memorized the pages and may offer to trade books with
you so you don't spend all your time flipping pages. There will be at
least one, probably two hymnals in the rack too. If they're the
normal ones the contemporary service uses the green on and the
traditional service uses the red one. 
</P>
<P>The service is in parts. The first part is participative prayers
and singing (you read your part out of the service book). Normally
you kneel to pray and stand to sing; there's a little fold-out
cushioned bench to kneel on and its OK to rest your bum on the pew. 
</P>
<P>The second part is readings and a sermon; you sit for those with
the exception of standing when the Gospel is read -- the priest says
something like &quot;please stand for the Gospel&quot; so you don't
need to worry about cues. The prayer books have lots of expository
sections in them that make good reading if the sermon drags on or the
readings are dull. I usually bring crayons and paper for the girls to
get them through the listening part, since that generally helps
children listen better. 
</P>
<P>The third part is prayers -- you kneel, and may have a phrase to
recite over and over on cue, like someone says &quot;Lord in your
mercy,&quot; and the congregation answers &quot;hear our prayer.&quot;
Again, they'll tell you at the time. The fourth part is communion,
for which, as Higgs says, you'll need a separate instruction manual
unless you just stay in your seat or go with the flow. The fifth part
is a recap of the first; prayers and singing. A lot like a good
symphony in three movements with two overtures, actually.

<P>Communion *is* a deep thing...</P>
<P>...equal, and intrinsically linked to baptism. It is a direct
participation in Christ's death and resurrection by sacramentally
consuming his body and blood. You're right, it *is* exclusive, and
some Anglican churches do offer &quot;open&quot; communion to anyone
who wishes to join with Christ in this way regardless of their
Baptismal status. But it's more than just a symbolic shared lunch.
The Bible has a verse that says &quot;whosoever eats and drinks
unbelieving, eats and drinks damnation&quot;. So most churches
believe it is a kindness to prevent unbelievers from eating or
drinking damnation, rather like preventing children from sharing the
stuff out of the medicine cabinet that is beneficial to their sick
sibling (it doesn't affect the experience of others). I took
communion before I was a believer, and look what happened to me! 
</P>
<P>There is usually coffee time after church. The Orthodox have a
nice custom of consecrating only part of the bread and wine, and
offering the unconsecrated portion to the Seekers in the community.
That gets around the exclusivity nicely without either trivializing
the Blood/Flesh part of the sacrament or repulsing those who want to
&quot;take part&quot; without becoming &quot;one with him&quot;.
Anglicans' &quot;coffee after the service&quot; performs the same
function and is jokingly called &quot;the Eighth Sacrament&quot;. 
</P>
<P>If you do decide to try Orthodox, you have a plethora of them to
choose from because of the Ukrainian influence. I'd try Saint
Barbara's on 97th street. They used to exchange priests with the
Anglican cathedral, which suggests they're more open than the typical
American Orthodox church. 
</P>
<P>Anglican priests are usually called by their first name, but may
be called Reverend or Father (or Mother). In third person you will
hear their congregations refer to them as &quot;the Rector&quot;.
&quot;Pastor&quot; refers to a shepherd (as in &quot;pastoral&quot;)
and in churchy language implies someone whose personal emphasis is on
caring for his flock rather than on &quot;rectitude&quot;. But Pastor
is usually used by more right-wing churches, which may be where you
got the stuffy conotation.

<P>Anything, rather than work on budgets!...</P>
<P>although I do have to have them done by tomorrow a.m. 
</P>
<P>I actually used to date I guy who lived in Sherwood Park back in
the late 70's, and knew people living there back in the 60's. There
was a lot of early German immigration into the centre of the
province; my Grampa grew up there, and his second language was German
(his first was Gaelic; he was fluent in English and could get by in
Ukrainian). Which brings us to Scottishness, Presbyterians, and
Canada. 
</P>
<P>In the 1960's, there were more Gaelic-speakers in Canada than in
Scotland (TV is killing it now). There were also more Catholic Scots
in Canada than in Scotland. This is because the English *won* in
Scotland, loaded the Catholic/Gaelic Scots onto leaky sieves, and
shipped them out to make room for lowlander-Presbyterians and sheep.
Some modern Scot's don't even realize there *are* Catholic Scots
until they visit Nova Scotia. So if your heritage is Jacobite (i.e.
18th-century deportee Scots), its no wonder Presbyterians give you
the heebies. 
</P>
<P>Lutherans are a strange breed, and get stranger the more I learn
about them. LCC and ELCIC share ads and offices and use the same
service book and stationery, but don't share communion. At least, the
ELCIC invite the LCC to partake at theirs but the LCC won't, and the
LCC expect the ELCIC not to partake at theirs but the ELCIC partake
anyway. The ELCIC are in dialog with the homosexual community and in
limited communion with the Anglican church (the LCC aren't
interested) but individual ELCIC churches are downright
fundamentalist. Some Lutheran churches are as baroquely Catholic
(meaning they have incense and chanting) as the highest Anglican; at
ours you miss the consecration if you blink. The Anglican church took
me years to figure out; I'm *never* going to understand Lutherans.
Short form, if it's just a field trip, you won't notice the
difference, but I'd go ELCIC. 
</P>
<P>The Baptist service will be a long, long sermon bracketed by some
prayers and music. Note that up front and centre where the Catholic
churches have an altar, is a huge baptismal font, though it may be
behind a curtain. In my opinion, Baptist services are boring. 
</P>
<P>The Catholic service will be very like the Anglican one, except
for subtle differences like who's in the procession and the colour of
the books in the pews. Also, the church will be full with many
children, whereas the Anglican services are half-full with few
children. 
</P>
<P>Oh, I remember what I was going to tell you about tomorrow: in
most churches, just after the first part, the Rector calls the
children up for a &quot;children's message&quot;, then they truck the
children off to Sunday School. Right after the consecration, the
children return so they can take communion with their parents and
stay with them until the end of the service -- or the parents may
have to slip out to fetch them. I don't know what your target church
will do since they have that &quot;Christian Education Hour&quot; as
well as childcare/Sunday-school, but Bridget may just go up for the
children's message and then come back to sit with you if that's what
she wants. If she slips off with the other children in search of milk
and cookies you'll have to worry about when to bring her back, so
target another parent in the church to keep an eye on and if she
slips out after the prayers, follow her and ask where your child is. 
</P>
<P>The weird names are usually &quot;non-denominational&quot;
churches (which is itself becoming a denomination &lt;g&gt;), usually
fundamentalist or pentecostal. Guessing from their sister-churches
here I would say the Church of the Nazarene is puritan (central
pulpit instead of altar or baptismal font emphasising a focus on
biblical literalism, fundamentalist, service much like Baptist) and
the Alliance church is mildly pentecostal (central stage with drumkit
and guitars, lots of singing to start the service, big choir with
high production values, maybe drama and dancers). 
</P>
<P>The Moravians are, like the Anglicans, a remnant from the
pre-Roman stage of Christian expansion: a church with ancient roots
predating the centralized Roman authority. In the early church,
Bishops had complete independence under Christ, and the really
distant missionary Bishops were cut off from the debates about
orthodoxy that were going on in Rome. As a result, they preserved a
pre-roman understanding of Christianity but also incorporated a
degree of spirituality from their host culture. And, of course,
throughout the subsequent almost-two-millenia they were influenced by
the events around them, including renewing contact with an altered
Roman church that called them heretics, and co-existing with the
Reformation Church as the strange bed-fellows that common conflicts
make. The Moravians have a strong tradition of really good brass
ensembles, and hang multi-pointed stars at Christmas in place of
trees. Unfortunately, I know nothing about their actual doctrine,
except that the Moravians I know here are pretty cool.
