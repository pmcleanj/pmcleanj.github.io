<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Why do you tolerate the Harry Potter movies?
</FONT>
</P>
<P>It would be so nice if good and evil came with clear labels: ...</P>
<P>This movie is about imaginary people who fly on broomsticks, so
it's Evil; that movie is about a talking cucumber, so it's Good. This
person wears a tall black hat, so she's Evil; that person spends
Sunday morning in Church, so she's Good. 
</P>
<P>Good and Evil are real forces. Witchcraft -- &quot;Wicca&quot; --
is a real religious movement. We tend to group a number of odd and
largely-unrelated religious movements, fads, and groundless
superstitions together under the term &quot;the occult&quot;. That is
an over-simplification, that allows us to vilify without
understanding. Real witchcraft *is* un-Christian. While it is
reasonable for Christian parents to be concerned about something that
might lure their children away from the Christian faith, children
routinely read about people from other religions without risking
apostacy. We rarely debate whether our children should read every-day
story-books about Jewish people (for example &quot;The Diary of Anne
Frank&quot; which is on most middle-school reading lists, the mystery
&quot;Sunday the Rabbi Stayed Home&quot;, Chaim Potek's excellent
&quot;The Chosen&quot;, the lovely old classic &quot;The All of a
Kind Family&quot;) or about Muslim People (Debra Ellis' excellent
&quot;The Breadwinner&quot;, Marguarite Henry's &quot;King of the
Wind&quot;). In my childhood, missionary societies published stories
depicting the cultures to which their missionaries were headed.
Stories about other religions just help us understand the plurality
of worldviews among which we live. Some Christians consider Wicca
differently from Islam or Judaism because of mistranslations in the
Bible where the word &quot;witch&quot; has been incorrectly used. Be
assured that the ancient Hebrew language did not have a specific word
for &quot;priestess of the Northern European nature religion&quot;.
The ancient Hebrews didn't even know that the Celts existed. 
</P>
<P>So, if there were any reality, any actual validity to the
depiction of witches in Harry Potter, I would still find it
unobjectionable. But, in fact, the &quot;witches&quot; depicted in
Harry Potter are drawn directly out of mediaeval folk-tales, with no
basis in reality. They are imaginary. In the same way, singing,
dancing cucumbers are imaginary. The Bible deals with the reality of
spiritual issues; not with imaginary things used to populate
fictional stories. So, to determine whether a movie or story is moral
or not, we need to look past the superficial labels borne by the
characters, at the morality of the themes. 
</P>
<P>I've read all four Harry Potter books. I *don't* find them to be
unprecedented wonders of imaginative fiction: I grew up on Mary
Norton and E. Nesbitt and Alan Garner. I do have issues with the
paedagogical assumptions that seem to underpin Hogwarts as an
institution: I hope my children never find school to be an
unpredictable place where the staircases change direction while
you're climbing them and the adults are more interested in
point-scores than in nurture. The admiration afforded Harry seems
misplaced: frankly the Muggle-born Hermione seems to be the one who
actually exhibits talent, skill, intellect and diligence. But, the
overall message Anne has taken away from the books was best summed up
by Dumbledore in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;: 
</P>
<PRE> &quot;Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when you
 have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy,
 remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and
 brave.&quot;</PRE><P>
Or, in older and more noble words, &quot;Greater love hath no man
than this, that he lay down his life for his friends&quot;. If that
is what my child remembers as the theme of these books, I can
tolerate a great many moving staircases.
