<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">Tomorrow is our
Great Easter Vigil - that at least 2 hours, and maybe even longer.
Our parish encourages children to attend this service and even
realizes this may be a long time for them... but our daughter is only
five, and 'spirited',  and I can not fathom how we'll last!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Both my daughters officially measure as
&quot;spirited&quot; (according to Anne's psychologist, who pointed
out that their parents probably do, too.) I never considered Anne
spirited, because compared to Rachel she's calm rationality. Rachel's
wiggles get right under my skin at times. 
</P>
<P>That being said, we routinely have a two-hour service, and the
girls do just fine. Of course, we attend a charismatic congregation
that is very wiggle-tolerant. In fact, the adult portion are as
likely to be raising holy hands and moving holy feet as the children,
though *they* tend to limit their wiggles to the musical interludes.
Even so most of the Anglican members of the combined congregation do
send their children out to childcare after the children's lesson. My
experience is that the more you include, engage, and teach the
children about what is going on in the liturgy, the more able they
will be to participate in it instead of disrupting it. That means, of
course, that you have to spend several years being willing to whisper
explainations when you would rather be in prayer, and putting up with
snubs and sneers from those of your fellow congregants who consider
your whispering to your children to be inappropriate. The upside is
that there *is* a pay-off: the children who are routinely sent out of
the service don't have the same ability to participate and find even
a one-hour Lutheran service too much for them to sit through; the
children who routineky stay have coping skills. 
</P>
<P>I swear by &quot;sermon summaries&quot; for mid-sermon wiggles. I
keep a pack of pencil-crayons and a small enclosed pencil-sharpener
in our pew (hidden from the altar guild behind a strategic Hymnal
LOL!) and bring small half-lined/half-plain school notebooks for each
child (for my four, and also for other of the stay-in-church
children!). I prep the children carefully before the service with the
lectionary readings, so that they recognize them when they're read
and catch the tie-ins in the sermon. They can write in the notebook
or draw pictures, illustrating the points in the sermon. This too,
works on a learning curve: my part-time son and daughter, used to
structured colouring books, started by colouring the entire page one
colour; moved to colouring each line in the lined portion, and
gradually began drawing and colouring pictures largely unrelated to
the sermon. Anne does detailed folk-art Christian symbols often
intertwined with the text, and Rachel copies whatever Anne draws. But
they've had the advantage of seeing a lot of my doodles of
traditional knot-work and folk-art patterns. For PTS and PTD, I'll
sometimes take my own sermon-summary book so I can model doodling
Christian symbols (&quot;art meditation&quot;). I'll also sometimes
draw pictures in their books for them to color. I don't get them very
often any more, but they are slowly learning appropriating both
Lutheran and Anglican iconography for themselves. Lately, of course,
I've been preparing pew-work sheets with cross-words, quizzes and
wordfinds. These which appeal more to my left-brained children than
the sermon-summaries do. The right-brained children just draw
pictures in the margins. I try to be careful not to hand out the
books or work-sheets until the sermon, and to gather them up at the
end of the sermon, so that the children don't play with them during
hymns or prayers when they should be participating. 
</P>
<P>The Vigil is a different kittle of fish, though. I didn't take
Anne until she was 4, and didn't take Rachel until last year (6).
Even though our church isn't crowded for this service, it runs very
late. You need to know that your child will be able to fall asleep
when enough is enough, and the crowding would tend to prevent that
(when Rachel crashed last year, I just tucked her up in my coat and
laid her on the pew beside me.) The candles are another issue -- you
know each child is going to want her own, and you know you're going
to be in horror of her setting someone on fire. But, that's just part
of being a mother, isn't it&lt;g&gt;? All in all, the service is too
beautiful, too moving, to deprive your child of incorporating it into
her earliest memories if you can possibly manage it. But it's going
to be a judgement call regarding what you can manage, and when. 
</P>
<P>In our house it's fairly easy: Dean's evangelical, I'm the
catholic. So if someone has to stay home, it ain't gonna be me!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I wish I could forward this statement
-- &quot;they find it frustrating not to be able to participate as
much as we do because they can't read&quot; -- to every worship
committee and liturgy planner. We adults can get so arrogantly smug
about our literacy that we don't even notice others who are
handicapped without it: not just preschool children, but also elderly
grandparents whose eyesight is going, refugees or immigrants whose
full literacy is in a different language, and adults with secret
dyslexia (a bigger problem than most pastors know). The solution is
so easy: introduce new hymns slowly, repeat some hymns from week to
week, and give non-literate worshippers a chance to learn the hymns
by memory. 
</P>
<P>I regularly ask the worship teams to let me know what the hymns
ahead of time so that I can review them with the children. Sing it a
few times in the car between activities, or around the house, or as a
lullaby at bedtime, and by Sunday the children will recognize it
happily and know at least the chorus or first verse. It would be
trivial for the church secretary to email the hymn list to mothers
who wanted to prepare their children; or for the deacon to read out
next week's hymn-list with the rest of the announcements. But no
matter how many times I ask, it's not important enough to anyone
else. So far the only reliable way I've found to get the music ahead
of time, is to be married to one of the worship-team. Does your
husband happen to play an instrument?</P>
