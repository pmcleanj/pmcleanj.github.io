Jesus said, &quot;You are the light of the world.  A city built on a
hill cannot be hid.  No one lights a lamp to put it under a
bucket, but on a lamp-stand where it gives light for everyone
in the house.  And you, like the lamp, must shed light among
your fellow men, so that they may see the deed you do, and
give glory to your Father in heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 5:14-16)

It is not ourselves that we proclaim; we proclaim Christ
Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants, for Jesus' sake.
For the same God who said, &quot;Out of darkness let light shine,&quot;
has caused his light to shine within us, to give the light of
revelation--the revelation of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ.  (2 Corinthians 4:5-6)
 
If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will cover me, and the light
around me turn to night,&quot; darkness is not dark to you, O </PRE>

you are both alike.  (Psalm 139:10-11)
 

Officiant: Let us pray.


In Advent:
Almighty God, give us grace that we may cast away the
works of darkness, and put upon us the armor of light, now
in the time of this mortal life in which thy Son Jesus Christ
came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when
he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the
quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through
him who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost,
one God, now and for ever.
Amen.

Christmas, Epiphany, and other Feasts of the Incarnation:
Almighty God, who hast poured upon us the new light of
thine incarnate Word:  Grant that the same light, enkindled in
our hearts, may shine forth in our lives; through the same
Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.
Amen.
