<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I have a strange
question. <FONT SIZE=3><FONT COLOR="#00008b">I grew up in the
Episcopal church, took some time off due to the minster.... Anyway
since DD was baptized, our new minister has given her a piece of a
communion wafer. Is this not acceptable? I have noticed many strange
looks from other people.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Your question isn't strange at all. Child communion is a very
ancient, and quite recent practice of the Church. It's just that
there's a little intervening period of a few hundred years during
which it *wasn't* practiced, that some older or more conservative
members are having trouble getting over. 
</P>
<P>Doctrinally, we believe that Baptism is a full, complete and
adequate initiation into the life of the chuch. You know that from
the many times you've recited the Creed &quot;We believe in One
Baptism for the remission of sins&quot;. The Holy Eucharist is the
food of the Church. Everyone who is a member of the Church has the
right and duty to partake in the Holy Eucharist. The Traditional
Anglican catechism says that we acknowledge &quot;two sacraments as
generally necessary for salvation: that is to say baptism, and the
Supper of the Lord&quot;. 
</P>
<P>In spite of this doctrine, the practice arose in the church of
witholding the eucharist from people until they were confirmed; and
of reserving confirmation to adults who were able to make the
promises for themselves. In the 1970's when the churches went through
a period of radical reform, the ancient practice of &quot;communion
of the baptized&quot; was restored. But many people still didn't
practice it with children, and especially not with very young
children or with babies. Many people want their children to
&quot;understand what it means&quot; before they partake of
communion. 
</P>
<P>I would argue that, if we had to wait until we &quot;understand&quot;,
there would be a very empty altar rail each Sunday. We don't withold
Baptism on the basis of understanding, because we acknowledge that it
is God's grace and the actions of the church that effect the
sacrament, not the attitude of the catechumen being baptized. The
same doctrine holds for communion, which is also a sacrament.
Besides, children &quot;understand&quot; very well the feelings of
being left out or included. 
</P>
<P>Your minister is acting correctly, both from the perspective of
doctrine and the perspective of compassion. Both of my daughters
received a drop of wine with a crumb of the host at their baptism. It
was their first food apart from breastmilk. 
</P>
