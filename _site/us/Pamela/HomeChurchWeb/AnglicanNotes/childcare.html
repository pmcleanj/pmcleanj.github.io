comprehensive overview of history will show that working is part of
the normal human condition. Work can be a dreary hopeless grind,
which is a consequence of the fall and no part of God's plan for us.
Or work can be a challenging and rewarding experience that adds value
to your day, because we are using God-given talents, a sure sign that
we are doing God's will for us.<BR><BR>That same study of history, or
of economics for that matter, will show you that the normal human
condition is laid out in community, with different people undertaking
different tasks so that the whole community's needs are met. And
those tasks are rewarded in different ways, wages and salaries being
only one kind of reward and not necessarily the best. Money is a good
symbol of value received, but it is not value per se. If we start
categorizing people's work as unselfish based on whose name is on the
deposit slip, or selfish based on whose name is on the withdrawal
slip, we're misapplying the symbol. Within the community, someone --
a wife, a husband, a grandparent, a hand-maid, a daycare -- needs to
be caring for the children at any given time. And someone needs to
plant the fields, and dig the wells, and maintain the Internet
infrastructure. And no one person can do all of it, so we rely on one
another.<BR><BR>That woman in Proverbs 31 who was trading in flax in
the marketplace and spinning it, planting vineyards with the fuit of
her hands, managing a household staff, and weaving tapestries of
purple -- she was working! And she had help with her children, or
what were all those handmaids doing after she gaveth them their
portion? Today we have daycare as an alternative to handmaids (and we
have live-in grandparents, and Filipino nannies, and day-homes, and
other choices too). Daycare may be &quot;meant&quot; for single
parent families but that does not imply that those are the only
families it is meant for. It's for <I><B>whoever </B></I>is being
called by God <U>or </U>constrained by necessity to do some work that
precludes caring for children for the duration of that work. And
no-one -- NO-ONE -- can decide who that is except the person who
faces that Call or that Necessity. <BR><BR>But whether you are called
to be with your own children 24/7, or whether you are called to care
for the children of others and receive a wage for doing it, or
whether you are relying on someone you have chosen to provide that
care for your own children while you work at something else, is not
the determiner of whether your children are well-reared or not.
People who use childcare alternatives <U>are </U>still rearing their
own children. The caregivers have considerable influence, but it
doesn't begin to outweigh the parents' if the parents care to use
their influence. And stay-at-home parents every bit as much as
wage-earning parents, if they shirk the role of primary influencer,
may find in retrospect that their children were reared by the
television and their peer-group. <BR><BR>If you commit to do right by
your children by whatever you choose, then your choices are not
selfish.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
