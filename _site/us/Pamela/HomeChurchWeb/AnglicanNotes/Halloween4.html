</P>
<P>We've always steered clear of the medaeival witch-stereotype, not
because I believe witches are evil ...</P>
<P>but because the stereotype is offensive to Wiccans, and because of
all the harm that that *stereotype* did to innocent people over the
centuries that the church promoted it. 
</P>
<P>The use of the word &quot;witch&quot; in the bible refers directly
to that stereotype, not to real witches. King James I -- sponsor of
the King James Version translation -- was one of the big promotors of
that stereotype and the author of the book &quot;Maleus Maleficarum&quot;
that gives us the description of witches as warty, bent-over old
hags. And as a result, thousands of poor elderly peasant-women, whose
worst offense was to be on the margins of society in a village where
an animal died or a child fell ill, were hideously tortured or
killed. 
</P>
<P>The actual words -- in Hebrew kashaph, more often translated as
&quot;sorcerer&quot;, and qecem, more often translated as
&quot;divination&quot;; and in Greek &quot;pharmakeia&quot;, more
often translated as &quot;sorcery&quot; and better translated as
&quot;drug abuse&quot; -- certainly did not, in their original
tongue, mean &quot;Priestesses of the Northern-European Nature
religion&quot;, which is what the root-word of &quot;witch&quot;
(wicca) actually refers to. 
</P>
<P>So, I tend to turn requests for witch-costumes into lectures on
social justice: in particular the need to defend powerless old women
being steam-rollered by urban legends, the need for religious
tolerance, and our need as a church to repent if the harm we have
done in the past in the name of evangelism. Usually my children will
rapidly accept some less-offensive costume, if only to shut me up
&lt;g&gt;.
