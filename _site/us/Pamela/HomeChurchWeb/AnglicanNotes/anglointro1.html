<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I've decided to
see if an Episcopal church is a good &quot;fit&quot; for my family. 
I know next to nothing about this church, other than I like what I've
seen in terms of theology as it relates to present, real life issues.
I've noticed that a lot of churches are named for saints - are you
taught about the saints (I don't even know how to ask the question,
lol, but I hope someone knows what I'm asking)? Do you have to become
a member before you can take Communion? If not, should you take it on
your first visit? If a church lists on its schedule of worship the
Holy Eucharist, Sunday Service and Christian Education(which I'm
guessing is Sunday School)what's the difference in services?</FONT></P>

<P>Etymology, history, doctrine and picayuny details...</P>
<P>The Anglican church is the traditional catholic church of England.
&quot;Anglican&quot; means &quot;of England&quot;. The Anglican
church is called &quot;Episcopal&quot; in the US (which means &quot;of
Bishops&quot;) 'cause you had this little fuss back in 1776 that led
you not to want to identify with England. 
</P>
<P>Prior to the eighth century, the Bishop of Rome did not exercise
authority over other Bishops. The Anglican church as we know it was
born out of Rome's 700-year struggle to assert that authority over
(largely Celtic) Bishops who had already put the stamp of their own
spirituality and culture on their worship style. Rome made
considerable impact on the Celtic-British clergy during the
Renaissance, aided by the Papally-sponsored Plantagenet invasion and
dynasty. The struggle culminated in Henry VIII's formally
establishing the Anglican church as explicitely independant from
Rome. (Normally this is described as &quot;Henry VIII started his own
church so he could marry Anne Boleyn&quot;, a gross and skewed
oversimplification). 
</P>
<P>Since we believe the Catholic church is the whole company of
Christian people, you &quot;become a member&quot; by being baptized.
In other words, you already are Anglican, you just don't know it yet
:-). We believe in &quot;the Communion of Saints&quot; -- which means
that all believers (both &quot;militant&quot; i.e. alive, and
&quot;triumphant&quot; i.e. dead), are joined in the body. So we
believe in saints, and we believe you are a saint. Some people
however, our tradition teaches us are exemplary saints, so we give
them a capital &quot;S&quot; and use it as a title. Since we don't
acknowledge any primal authority -- the Archbishop of Cantebury has
no authority over any bishops outside his own See -- there is no
official body to &quot;canonize&quot; Saints; just consensus of the
whole people. We acknowledge Scripture, Tradition and Reason as
sources of revelation, so calling someone a saint because it's
traditional to do so is good enough for us. 
</P>
<P>Some congregations have been more influenced by other movements:
Methodism, Lutheranism, and of course Romanism. Some of those
congregations may feel that you should be confirmed in an Anglican
church before taking communion. They're out of sync with the Anglican
communion at large, but they do exist. Check the bulletin, it usually
says something like &quot;all baptized persons are welcome at the
Lord's table&quot;. For legal reasons you usually have to do
something to qualify as a member to vote at the annual congregational
meeting, but it's usually a trivial and informal requirement, like
put your name in the church register. 
</P>
<P>There's no way to figure out ahead of time what kind of
congregation you're getting into. Besides, Heisenberg prevails so as
soon as you insert yourself you change the equation. You can try
interviewing the church staff by telephone, or getting cozy with the
diocesan secretary in the hopes that she'll gossip, but for practical
purposes you pretty much have to try them out. 
</P>
<P>The worship is written down in the prayerbook, which is cryptic
and hard to follow. The congregation will suddenly burst into
something vaguely song-like just when you thought they were going to
recite scripture. The nice parishioner in the next pew is supposed to
notice you flipping pages in confusion and mark pages for you.
Communion is taken in both kinds. You go up to the front in turn,
usually kneel down, and are given the bread -- or more commonly a
white wheatflour-wafer -- in your hands (to be formally correct, cup
them right over left and raise the bread directly to your mouth, but
don't worry cause most of us aren't formal nowadays anyway), then a
sip of wine from a common cup (guide the cup to your lips with your
hands). Sit in the middle of the pew so there's someone next to you
on both sides to copy. Some congregations have communion every week,
some every second week or so.
