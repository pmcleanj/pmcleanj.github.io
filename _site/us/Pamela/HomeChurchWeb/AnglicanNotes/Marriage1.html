<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=2>Well,
the Catechism in the 1662 prayerbook didn't mention Matrimony at all.
I think a weakness of the 1979 prayerbook is that it is trying to
include too much in what should be a basic summary of the faith, at
the level of essentials. The 1662 has the details and definitions
about marriage in the rubrics and content of the marriage service
itself. The other place I recall the 1662 mentioning Matrimony is in
Article 25, in which it states that Matrimony is not to be counted a
Sacrament.<BR><BR>It's important to note that the original question
of this thread is &quot;What is <I>Holy Matrimony</I>&quot; not &quot;what
is <I>Marriage</I>&quot;. Marriage is an cultural and anthropological
distinction defining the way that non-related adults form into family
groupings within a culture. In different cultures marriage does take
different forms. In terms of social anthropology, marriage has
several dimensions: legal, social, religious, and economic.<BR><BR>In
Canada, to take a familiar developed-world, western example,
common-law marriage has full legal force, enjoys all economic factors
of other marriage except inheritance law, and is socially acceptable
to the degree that it is indistinguishable from other forms of
marriage. And frankly, given the nature of Canada's taxation laws, a
common-law marriage where one partner is not working enjoys better
economic recognition at tax-time, than a registered marriage where
both partners work. The one difference I see between common-law
marriage and a marriage celebrated by a Priest or Deacon using a
valid service, is in its religious dimension -- in many cases
common-law marriage is not <I>Holy</I> Matrimony.<BR><BR>But that
same consideration applies to marriages effected in the marriage
commissioner's office, even though they are recorded in the register.
We have to wonder as well, if a church firmly denies that their
marriages have any sacramental force and the pastor merely acts as a
marriage commissioner himself -- say a marriage in an Evangelical
Free church -- whether that marriage is <I>Holy Matrimony</I>, or
just a secular marriage administered by a church official. <BR><BR>And
that chain of thought raises the question as whether a couple, not
having been to church since their grandmother brought them to the
baptismal font as infants to &quot;have them done&quot;, and not
planning to return again until the same grandma's funeral demands
their presence, can be truly said to be confecting &quot;Holy
Matrimony&quot; when they go through the motions in an Anglican
church without understanding any religious dimension to what is
happening there. They get a great traditional location, and the
stained glass makes a great background for their wedding photo album
-- but did they get Holy Matrimony?</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Dave. I'm going to try to take this on. God grant that I don't put my
foot in it too badly.<BR><BR>As Father Rick says, a marriage has a
dimension of contract law to it. A contract is formed when both
parties offer 'consideration' (make reciprocal commitments of some
sort). The contract is enforceable only if it is allowed by law.<BR><BR>In
Canada, your marriage is legal if it is performed by a marriage
commissioner according to the law, which varies slightly from
province to province. In Ontario, it is perfectly legal to be married
by banns, with no license. In Quebec, the only legal marriage is a
civil marriage by contract -- the religious ceremony must be
performed separately. Or a common-law arrangement is a legal marriage
if it lasts for longer than a year, provided that you are otherwise
free to marry -- that is, not legally married to someone else. So, it
is perfectly possible to have a <I>legal </I>marriage that has no
ceremony or license.<BR><BR>Now, the legal dimension is not the only
dimension to marriage. Marriage of course has a cultural dimension as
well. You can think of this as &quot;will the people with whom I
socialize treat my partner and me as married&quot; or as &quot;will
wedding invitations sent to us have both our names on the same line&quot;.
This will vary with social strata. Some people will not recognize
common-law marriages even though they are legal. Other people will
recognize common-law relationships that haven't lasted as much as
month, let alone a year.<BR><BR>But you asked specifically about the
religious dimension of Marriage. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9932cc"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><FONT SIZE=4><BR><BR>As
Fish and Bread said, Anglicans don't have unequivocal consistent
doctrine about marriage. Some of us believe that marriage is a
sacrament -- an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual
grace, given by God. But the question of what the outward and visible
sign has different answers. Some would say it is the declaration of
the minister (who need not be a priest: deacons can perform
marriages) &quot;I pronounce that they be man and wife together&quot;.
Others would say it is &quot;the giving and receiving of a ring&quot;,
or exchanging the words of the wedding vows. My priest explained that
it is the act of physical intimacy that is the &quot;outward and
visible sign&quot; of marriage, the inward and spiritual grace being
'the two becoming one flesh' at a spiritual level.<BR><BR>In all of
these conceptions of the 'outward and visible sign' save the first,
it is the husband and wife that effect the sign of the marriage; that
'confect' the marriage sacrament. The priest represents the Church,
since all sacraments were given <I>to </I>the Church for the building
up of the Body of Christ. So it is appropriate that a priest be
present. One or two other members of the Body are also required,
because the priest cannot function as &quot;Church&quot; alone --
there must be 'two or three gathered together in Christ's name'. But
it is the man and woman who &quot;marry&quot; each other. <BR><BR>In
fact, well into the eighteenth century in Scotland, a legal Christian
marriage could be confected by the husband and wife declaring before
any Christian witness, first that there was no impediment to
marriage, and second the simple vow &quot;I, <I>name</I>, take, you
<I>name</I>, as my <I>husband/wife</I>, in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&quot;.<BR></FONT></FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
