<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">You said that &ldquo;Stir Up Sunday&rdquo;
is the Sunday before Advent, but it's really the Third Sunday in
Advent &ndash; because that's the Sunday that has the &ldquo;Stir Up&rdquo;
collect. Also, I was wondering if you had a good recipe for
fruitcake? My grandmother always made fruitcake, but she never taught
us. The recipe we found in her belongs is no help at all - 29 cent
package of this, 39 cent package of that...lol. sigh. Anyway, we have
all agreed that a Harry and David Traditional Fruitcake is most like
what she used to make. Any suggestions? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Stir Up Sunday is an old tradition based on the 1662 prayer-book
collect for the Sunday Next Before Advent. Christmas puddings (and
cakes too, if you like) are made and steamed on that day, then set
aside to soak up alcohol and age until Christmas, allowing the
flavours of the fruit and alcohal to meld and mellow. 
</P>
<P>The collect is the reason it is called Stir-Up but you have the
wrong collect. The old collect was &quot;Stir up, O Lord, we beseech
thee, the hearts of thy faithful people, that they plenteously
bringing forth the fruits of good work may of thee be plenteously
rewarded. Amen&quot; . The stirring up of <I>power</I> is third week
in Advent and that is WAY too late to be making puddings. 
</P>
<P>One of the reasons that Liturgical reform was opposed in the
1970's was that adiaphoric traditions, like stirring up figgy duff,
bringing daffodils to you mother and eating simnel cake in Lent, and
so on, were eroded. Capital-&quot;T&quot; liturgical Tradition looks
for its precedents to the firstcenturies of the church, long before
figgy duff and simnel cake were invented. But humans look for
precedent to what happened when they were small boys (and girls) and
to what stories their parents told, and resent losing those
traditions. Another reason for opposing reform was that the Anglican
communion throughout the world would lose some of its uniformity of
practice. The relatively unchanging 1662 prayerbook, the same
throughout the world, protected those traditions and practices --
but, unacceptably, at the expense of ecumenism, contemporary
relevance, and the recovery of authentic Tradition. 
</P>
<P>The churches that retained the 1662 and achieved liturgical reform
through an alternate service book are accomodating &quot;t&quot;-tradition
while preserving &quot;T&quot;-Tradition. I suspect its more of a
challenge for Americans to preserve their small-&quot;t&quot;
traditions without strong word-of-mouth. 
</P>
<P>The Sundays in Advent already have their own focuses, encapsulated
in their (1662) collects. As the Christian year prior to Christmas
recapitulates history before Christ (what, 5000 years in four weeks
-- good we're not expecting to do an in-depth analysis, eh?&lt;g&gt;),
the collects in turn focus on: 
</P>
<PRE> - Advent I -   The Creation in particular, and the book of
                Genesis
 - Advent II -  Isaiah's prophecy in particular, The Law and
                the Prophets, the gift of Holy Scripture
 - Advent III - John the Baptist's ministry in particular, 
                ministry and evangelism
 - Advent IV  - The Blessed Virgin in particular, the immanence
                of Christ and of God's Power in the world.</PRE><P>
That's why Anglicans have &quot;Gaudete&quot; and a pink candle for
the fourth Advent Sunday, rather than the third Sunday as Roman
Catholics do. That fourth Sunday is also when the 1662 BCP has the
&quot;Raise up, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy power, and come among
us&quot; ... collect; but in the original English it's &quot;Raise
up&quot; rather than &quot;Stir Up&quot;. 
</P>
<P>Our (Canadian) BAS has, for the third Sunday of Advent, 
</P>
<PRE> &quot;God of power and mercy
  you call us once again
  to celebrate the coming of your Son.
  Remove those things which hinder love of you,
  that when he comes,
  he may find us waiting in awe and wonder
  for him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
  one God, now and for ever.&quot;</PRE><P>
The BAS moves the &quot;Stir-up&quot; collect to Proper 23 -- which
is okay for making dark fruit cake, but way too early for plum
puddings. If you leaf through your 1979, you may find the &quot;fruits
of good work&quot; translated to some other Sunday, too. 
</P>
<P>Ramblings on Fruitcake, Refrigeration, and History. Fruitcake is
basically a pound cake with fruit, and optionally other ingredients,
bound together by the cake. 
</P>
<P>In England, fruitcake was nearly a staple element of the diet in
pre-refrigeration times. Food is preserved by placing it in an
environment inimicable to bacteria. For example, you can heat it
until all the bacteria are killed, and then seal the storage
container. But pre-industrial technology didn't allow many foods to
get hot enough, and didn't produce reliable seals. You can freeze the
food, but outside twentieth-century technology only Inuit had the
means for this method. You can dry the food, or saturate the food
with salt, acid or sugar. These methods change the texture and
flavour of the food; but if they're the only choice you've got, you
can learn to like the changes. 
</P>
<P>Fruitcake is an example of preserving through sugar-saturation.
The majority of the sugar is concentrated naturally in the dried
fruits -- important because refined sugar is a late development, not
known in the middle ages. Nuts, and even meat, mixed with the fruits
provide protein. Letters and diaries of soldiers during the Great War
(1914-1918) refer to the fruitcake in their field rations:
tremendously rich and heavy, it provided much of a soldier's
nutritional requirements for energy and protein, and lasted well
without moulding or rotting, despite the total lack of proper food
storage facilities. Interestingly, the Plains Peoples (the Cree and
Tsitsika, and perhaps others) relied on the sugar in dried
saskatoons, pounded together with dried buffalo meat, in much the
same way. 
</P>
<P>Fruitcake stored properly will in fact last for decades. To store
it properly, first run a skewer through the cake several times, all
over it. Wrap it in cheese cloth and saturate the cheese-cloth with
brandy for several weeks, until the cake has absorbed as much brandy
as possible. Get an air-tight tin box about one inch bigger than the
cake all round. Put an inch of pulverized sugar in the bottom of the
box. Put in the cake, then fill all the remaining space with
pulverized sugar. Seal the box. 
</P>
<P>This enduring quality of fruitcake is why it is the traditional
cake for weddings. You could argue that the permanence of the cake is
symbolic of the permanence of marriage; but I suspect the permanence
of the cake's guaranteeing that you can serve it in any season of the
year that the marriage takes place, is also an influencing factor.
The American &quot;traditional&quot; white wedding cake is a much
later development, introduced to underscore the superiority of a
newly developed American milling technique that produced a very fine
white flour. It is still very much an American idea. I had no idea
that a wedding cake was &quot;supposed&quot; to be a white cake until
I started reading brides magazines in planning my own wedding;
Canadian and English wedding cakes are fruit cakes -- except of
course for those tradition-flouting brides who are busy deciding
between chocolate, and a yellow cake to match their wedding colours. 
</P>
<P>Still with me? I have no idea who Harry and David are (I doubt I
have ever had a store-bought fruitcake). However, if you give me your
grandma's recipe, I can make a stab at translating the proportions,
based on recipes I have with similar ingredients. I have dozens of
fruitcake recipes; ranging from quite ancient to quite modern, and
with ingredients that might make your eyes cross (suet and chopped
beef, for example). Modern fruitcakes are distinguished by being
either dark (made with molasses and brown sugar; and aged at least
six months) or light (made with white sugar and aged about six weeks)
and by whether they have nuts or not. 
</P>
<P>Here is the archetypical (IMHO) light fruitcake. It's the one my
mother used for my wedding cake; only she neglected to consider the
fact that I'm allergic to pineapple and palm-kernal oil, so I got
sick when I tried to eat some of it. 
</P>
<PRE> 125 ml (1/2 cup) cold water
 500 g  (1 lb -- about 2 cups packed down) blond or light
                 raisins, or in a pinch whatever dried
                 raisins, currents, plums, apricots or figs
                 you can find. Needless to say, substitutions
                 change the flavour of your results).</PRE><P>
Boil the water and dried fruit together -- do not scorch them -- and
let cool. 
</P>
<PRE> 180 g (3/4 cup -- I think that's one and a half sticks) butter
                   (NOT palm-oil margarine!)
 170 g (180 ml or 3/4 cup) white sugar, or in a pinch brown
                   sugar, and you'll have a dark fruitcake. The
                   darker the sugar, the darker the cake.</PRE><P>
Cream the butter and sugar together. 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm"> 3 eggs (that's the same metric or American!) </PRE><P>
Beat well, then beat into the butter-sugar mix. I just pack the
butter and sugar against one side of the mixing bowl, and beat the
eggs in the other side, then gradually encroach the beaters on the
butter/sugar clump. Saves on the washing-up that way. 
</P>
<PRE> 125 g (250 ml or 1 cup sifted) flour
   2 ml(1/2 tsp) Baking powder</PRE><P>
Sift together. Stir half of the flour/BP mixture gently into the
batter. 
</P>
<PRE>  30 ml (2 Tbsp) milk
   2 ml (1/2 tsp) lemon extract
  75 to 125 ml (3 to 5 oz.) jar of marischino cherries -- use
                            only the juice at this step. The
                            precise size depends on what your 
                            shop sells and your tastes (mine  
                            sells 125ml jars, and I *like* the
                            flavour of marischino)</PRE><P>
Stir the liquids into the batter. Add the other half of the flour/BP
mixture. 
</P>
<PRE> 750g (1&amp;1/2 lb -- about two cups packed down) mixed  
               dry/candied fruit. My preferred mixture is as
               follows:
               450 g (1 lb) candied fruit (NO pineapple!)
               225 g (8 oz.) candied cherries
               125 ml (5 oz.) jar of marischino cherries,
                              drained
  65 g (125ml or 1/2 cup sifted) flour</PRE><P>
Spread the fruit on a large platter, and sift the flour over it,
turning the fruit gently so it is coated with a thin layer of flour.
Stir the fruit/flour mixture into the batter. 
</P>
<P>Line pans with four layers of oiled paper, to insulate the pans
and ensure that none of the batter dries out during baking, but
rather steams slowly. Fill the pans almost full, as the fruit greatly
out-weighing the batter, the cakes hardly rise at all. The above
recipe will fill one 20-cm (8-inch) square cake tin about 8 cm (3
inches) deep; or one loaf pan with an awkward scrap left over --
perfect for a mini-loaf pan. Bake in a low oven (325 degrees) for
1&amp;1/2 to 2 hours: test with a toothpick for doneness. After an
hour of baking, cover the tops with oiled paper to prevent drying.</P>
