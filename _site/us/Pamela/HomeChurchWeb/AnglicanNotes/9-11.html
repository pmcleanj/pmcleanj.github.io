<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>I answer my children with the truth, always. Sometimes, though, I
am glad when they don't ask...</P>
<P>In this case, I heard the news at the filling station, while
trying to put enough pressure into the two flat front tires (which I
discovered when I got to the Wanda-Wagon this morning) to allow me to
limp to the tire-shop without damaging the rim. The station attendant
came and told me the news. Since Wanda is a rag-top the children
heard what he was saying, though his agitation and heavy accent
garbled the message somewhat. So they asked me to explain what he had
said. I was still trying to make sense of it myself -- I told them
that two air-liners had crashed, which is what I thought he had said.
The girls are aviation buffs, after their father; they realized the
seriousness of that. (I never dreamed I'd be wishing that was *all*
it had been.) 
</P>
<P>When Dean picked us all up at the tire shop, he had the radio on,
so they heard the news as we did. We kept turning it off for a minute
to re-state it for the children and allow them to ask questions,
which we answered as simply and factually as we could. I wept through
a couple of the answers, apart from which I tried to stay
matter-of-fact. I several times used the words &quot;I don't know
why. It was wrong and evil.&quot; 
</P>
<P>They talked about it a little in school; the school like us
believes in giving children facts and letting them explore together
the meaning and implications of those facts. Rachel's class, the
grade two/threes, came to a consensus that the people who did it had
done very wrong, but that they were dead, too. When I picked her up
from school, she seemed comfortable with that. She recognised that I
was still sad and worried, and hugged me protectively. 
</P>
<P>Anne's class (grade four/five) seems mostly to have skirted the
matter of motivation. She seemed less comfortable with it. She didn't
talk about it, but at dinner she made a rude and challenging comment
to something DH said about the event (he had been talking about the
emergency response teams). I explained to her that the people he had
been talking about had gone into the building to save others, and had
been killed, willfully giving their lives to save others -- and that
many of them were parents who would not come home. She got somber,
and didn't say anything else. 
</P>
<P>I think it may take her a long time to process this; maybe I came
down too hard on her. Navigating through Anne's obsessiveness and
hyper-restraint, without under-challenging her or letting her armour
herself with flippancy, may be the biggest challenge of my parenting.
