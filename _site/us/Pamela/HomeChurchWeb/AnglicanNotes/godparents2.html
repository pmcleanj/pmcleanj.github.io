<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">We don't have an
Episcopal church near us, so I was thinking of visiting a Lutheran
church on Sunday. I know at one time, weren't the Episcopal church
and the Lutheran church in the middle of talks regarding recognizing
each other? Did this ever happen, and if so, do you know what
particular branch of Lutheranism it involved? Also, does anyone know
anything about the different branches of the Lutheran church?</FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>I presently worship in a Lutheran congregation. There are a couple
dozen different Lutheran sects in North America ...</P>
<P>The one that has entered into &quot;CCM&quot; (Common Call to
Ministry) with ECUSA is the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
(ELCA). Don't get mislead by the &quot;Evangelical&quot; in the
title. They're as catholic, liturgical, sacramental, liberal and
intellectual as Lutherans come. 
</P>
<P>Lutherans and Anglicans -- even the non-ELCA Lutherans who go a
long way in the non-liberal non-catholic direction -- have always
recognized one another's baptisms. In fact, both have always
recognized the baptisms of *any* Christian church that uses water and
the Tridentine formula; even those like Baptists and Pentecostals who
don't recognize our baptisms. 
</P>
<P>The form of the service in the Lutheran Book of Worship is very
like our post-liturgical-reform service. For the most part you will
feel very much at home. Some older Lutherans replace the word
&quot;Catholic&quot; in the Creed with the word &quot;Christian&quot;,
but that's a pretty trivial difference. Some texts are differently
translated (their version of the words of welcome to the newly
baptized are one of the ugliest arhythmic pieces of liturgical prose
I've ever seen) but remain quite recognizable. 
</P>
<P>With Common Call to Ministry, which has been ratified by both
national synods (and a simlar accord has been ratified between their
sister churchs in Canada), we now recognize one another's orders.
That was quite a hurdle, because the ELCA and ELCIC (Evangelical
Lutheran Church in Canada) have a very different understanding of the
apostolic succession than do ECUSA and the ACC (Anglican Church of
Canada). Since Anglicans believe that the Eucharist must be
consecrated by a priest, and that a priest can only be ordained by a
Bishop, and that a Bishop is an heir of the apostolic succession; you
can see how we could hardly receive the ministry of Lutheran pastors
without coming to some acceptance of their understanding of the
succession. And, it was very contentious. 
</P>
<P>Lutherans tend to be more congregationalist than Anglicans. They
recognize the concept of &quot;joining the church&quot; by which they
mean the local congregation, and the local congregations have their
own constitutions and the power to make decisions that in the
Anglican communion would normally be reserved to the Bishop or
national synod. They do not believe in any sacraments except Baptism
and Communion; and their handling of the bread and wine that remain
after communion can be somewhat cavalier compared to its reverent
handling among Anglicans (I have seen it buttered and served with
soup!!! and I have seen it tossed in the trash!!!!) but it can also
be treated as reverently as in the most Anglo-catholic of parishes. 
</P>
<P>Lutheran Chorale is a different style from Sarum Plainchant, but
it is very beautiful. Lutherans are more likely than Anglicans to
sing old German hymns in wonderful four-part harmony. Since
sojourning among them I've been learning to sing the actual contralto
line, instead of straining for soprano notes that were never intended
for my rather mezzo range. 
</P>
<P>Oh, and Lutherans don't kneel -- they just sit for those parts of
the service. You probably want to avoid the LCMS (Lutheran Church
Missouri Synod) -- they won't receive you for communion anyway, until
you are confirmed within their synod, since they see communion as a
symbol of doctrinal correctness and non-LCMS Christians aren't
doctrinally sound; and WELS (Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod) --
they don't even receive LCMS Lutherans for communion because the LCMS
aren't strict enough.
