<P>So, now that the pageantry is winding down, what were the
liturgical highlights and, for that matter, lowlights, of your Easter
Season? 
</P>
<P>In 2001, the lows for me were attending a Lutheran Maundy, having
my heart flutter with relief at the familiar sight of basin and towel
sitting at the foot of the altar, and then discovering that we were
going to do a ceremonial ***hand*** washing. Right after reading the
Gospel: 
</P>
<PRE> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, 
 but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, 
 He that is washed needeth not save to wash his FEET,
                    The King James Version,
                    (Cambridge: Cambridge) 1769. 
                    (emphasis mine)</PRE><P>
Is it just me, or is this a little *too* much reduction for good
liturgy? Almost as bad as attending the Holy Saturday Exultet service
in broad daylight, since we are far enough north here, and Easter
late enough this year, that sunset came long after most of the
19:30-scheduled services were over. What's wrong with a Midnight Mass
held sometime closer to Midnight? 
</P>
<P>The highs were, first, going to my old church for the Exultet (our
second Exultet of the night, and we would never have even come near
if any other church had offered an actual *night* service). They lit
a proper bonfire in the churchyard, and processed the light properly
into the church. There's a new priest there since my time, who sings
beautifully, so the actual Exultet was fantastic. And we got a deeply
symbolic Anglican Eucharist, with a reverently proclaimed
consecration, with a common cup, and real wine even for Anne. Since
Holy Saturday Vigil isn't a 1662 prayer-book service (and is therefor
&quot;new&quot; and &quot;non-traditional&quot; despite having been
the practice of the first-millenium church), the judgementally
traditionalist crowd was mostly unrepresented, and the lunatic fringe
Traditional crowd were out in force. So, Anne and I were made very
welcome, and enjoyed being able to fellowship with her and Rachel's
godparents (Rachel was unfortunately left behind to work on keeping
her temper, a struggle she has had to deal with lately). 
</P>
<P>The second high was actually baking, and managing to get to church
with, my Easter Bread. It rose beautifully into a gorgeous even
cherry-stuffed wreath. This is a big deal because haven't found the
enthusiasm to bake an Easter Bread since the Easter Sunday that we
were asked to leave Saint Stephen's; so it was a breakthrough, and a
recovery from a little of my woundedness, and a little -- a very
little -- offering in acceptance of my Lutheran sojourn. 
</P>
<P>The subxequent year, our Vigil was a rather aenemic affair. We
went in to the fully-lit nave, and after several minutes of detailed
instruction, the lights were extinguished and the Easter Candle --
lit from a BIC lighter in the Narthex -- processed in before our eyes
had had chance to adjust to the dark. I wonder why they have drifted
away from the awesome drama of previous years. Perhaps it is just too
much work (that seems spurious to me though), or perhaps it has too
many pagan parallels (which I heartily love -- pagan means &quot;of
the countryside&quot;, and God is as present in the meadows as in the
cloister), or perhaps it's just too uncomfortable and undignified to
stand around in the churchyard being lashed by the Wind. The Exultet
was still awesome, though, and several people made a point of coming
up and greeting me as though I were a long-lost cousin. 
</P>
<P>There was no asperges and no baptism, alas! In the old days,
Mother Julia used hyssop (another pagan parallel I suppose), IIRC
correctly, as often as evergreen boughs; down at the Cathedral they
have a nice clean silver aspergum -- like a silver baby's rattle with
piercings through the ball, so the Dean can sprinkle his congregation
without quite so many drips on his pretty robes. 
</P>
<P>One of the pastors on Liturgy-L was doing an immersion baptism on
Easter Sunday; his biggest question for that list was: what does one
wear in the water if you're the one administering the Sacrament, and
do you go change out of your dripping cassock before celebrating the
Eucharist! I believe the answers were; you do take off your alb, and
you do put on a dry cassock afterwards &lt;g&gt;. 
</P>
<P>Because I was down in California until late Good Friday night, I
missed most of the other drama of Holy Week, too. I was very pleased
that Dean led the girls through their little Agape (seder memorial)
meal, which is a nice domestic memorial of the Last Supper. They
didn't go to church that night, and I don't even know if the service
would have been Maundy and Stripping the Altar; but they washed each
other's feet at home, and that's a very pretty little custom, too.
And he did take them to Good Friday services, although again the
services weren't the Way of the Cross or the Tre-Oro. Some Lutheran
churches *do* hold those services, but ours is far to the Evangelical
end of the ELCIC spectrum, alas. 
</P>
<P>Still, I think Dean did a pretty great job nurturing the girls'
spirits while he was single-parenting at that special time. I'm
pretty proud of him.
