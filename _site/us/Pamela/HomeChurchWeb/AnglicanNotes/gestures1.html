<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">My DH and I have decided to become confirmed
Episcopalians. Unfortunately, the classes don't begin until
September. We were told basically to jump right in, but WHERE? I
mean, I have no problem taking communion. DH and I were both baptized
before. Do we jump in from the start? Bowing to the crucifix? Doing
the sign of the cross? Bowing before being seated?I truly want to get
involved, but we don't even &quot;know how&quot; to make the sign of
the cross. I mean we know, but what does it mean? Then the whole
using the back of your thumb over your forhead, lips, and heart. We
love the church, but I feel silly asking them this! I do want to do
all of this. That was a part that drew me to the Anglican Church. I
love the Pomp and Circumstance. I just needed to know why I was doing
it and since I am not &quot;Episcopalian&quot; yet, is it
sacreligous?</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I understand, 110%25. Processions,
incense, candles and plainchant are what lured me to Christ's feet.

<P>First of all, you *are* Episcopalian. There is only one holy and
catholic Church, and the means by which one becomes a member of that
Church is Baptism. You are just coming to realize that Episcopal
tradition is the *best* way of participating in that Church (no bias
here, LOL!), and that liturgy is more powerful than dogma any day.
Confirmation is the sacrament by which you take up your personal
ministry as a Christian laywoman; whatever that ministry may be. A
personal ministry is the natural outcome of mature Christianity. 
</P>
<P>Second, many *Anglicans* are not used to the gestures you
describe. They are characteristic of the &quot;high church&quot;
tradition. People do them because the actions help people feel more
worshipful; people who don't find them helpful don't do them.
Speaking as a dancer, I recommend using your body to worship because
it is a part of the whole, holy *you*. We are not gnostics, to deny
the godliness of our material bodies. In fact, the traditional prayer
after communion talks about &quot;committing our selves, our souls
and bodies, into Thy service...&quot;. The worship gestures are more
meaningful, of course, when you understand their relevance: 
</P>
<P>Bowing as the crucifix passes in procession, and bowing when the
name of Jesus is mentioned in the Creed, recall the scripture that
&quot;at the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow&quot;. Some people
*do* bow the knee, but most just nod their head. Or not if it feels
awkward; the point is to make sure that your *heart* bows to Jesus.
For kinesthetic or artistic learners, the gesture helps, that's all. 
</P>
<P>The sign of the cross recalls the scripture that &quot;as we have
died with Him, so we are raised with Him to new life&quot;. If the
manual act helps you claim that promise, do it. Probably only about
half of Anglicans, or fewer, actually use the sign of the cross. It's
used, if at all, when the Trinity is named in a doxology (&quot;Glory
be to the Father -touch your forehead - and to the Son - touch your
chest - and to the Holy Ghost - touch your left shoulder, then your
right, or right and then left if you want to show solidarity with the
Eastern Church &lt;g&gt;) and when we say &quot;the resurrection of
the body and the life everlasting&quot; at the end of the Creed. Most
Anglicans don't themselves use the sign of the cross during the
blessing, because the priest makes it over them. 
</P>
<P>Bowing to the altar, the tabernacle (that's the cupboard where the
reserved, or already-consecrated, sacrament is stored) or the exposed
sacrament (that's the consecrated bread and wine left out on the
altar after the service) recognizes the real presence of Christ in
the sacrament. You're bowing to the present Christ. Almost all
Anglicans do this, even ones who don't use the other worship
gestures. 
</P>
<P>The thingy with the back of the cross is done during the Gospel
acclaimation when you say &quot;Glory be to thee, oh Lord&quot; or
whatever new-fangled words are in your prayer book. I've never seen
the American 1979 book, so I'm a little ignorant there. You draw a
cross on your forehead and say to yourself &quot;write Thy word upon
my mind&quot; then on your lips &quot;that I may speak it with my
lips&quot; then over your heart &quot;and dwell upon it in my heart&quot;.
Again, less than half of Anglicans actually use this gesture. 
</P>
<P>Bottom line: the liturgy is by definition the work of the People:
*you*. If worship gestures are an important element for you of the
treasure that is the Anglican liturgy, claim them. They are yours, to
use or not as *you* choose. 
</P>
<P>Even if you weren't baptised, there would be nothing sacreligious
about using worship gestures if you meant them reverently. Make a
point of getting to all the special services with all their
acoutrements: incense, candle-light, foot-washing and stripping the
Altar before Easter, processions, litanies -- you will love them. If
you are a needlewoman, consider making hangings or paramets for
special festivals. Don't hesitate to give in whatever area God is
calling you.
