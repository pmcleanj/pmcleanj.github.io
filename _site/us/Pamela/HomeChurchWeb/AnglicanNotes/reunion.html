-- albeit asymmetric -- communion already exists between that portion
of the Catholic Church that is in communion with Rome, and that
portion of the Catholic Church which is in communion with Canterbury.
We accept, for example, the validity of Catholic Orders -- naturally,
because our own orders are Catholic. We accept the validity of
Catholic Sacraments -- again, because our own sacraments are
Catholic. We accept Catholics at our altars, and welcome them to
share with us in the Lord's Supper -- because we ourselves are
Catholic. How much more union should we wish for?<BR><BR>Well, to be
frank, we could wish that the communion be reciprocal. But Vatican
documents, such as the relatively recent <A HREF="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html" TARGET="_blank">Dominus
Iesus</A>, have been explicit that that portion of the Catholic
Church which is in communion with Rome will not consider communion
with any portion of the Catholic Church that doesn't submit to the
authority of the Bishop of Rome. And we are very clear and committed
to the Tradition that the authority of Bishops is final and
independent. We respect highly the office of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, but he is not (despite what you regularly read in the
secular press, not known for its accuracy on spiritual matters) &quot;the
spiritual leader of 77 million Anglicans world wide&quot;. Primates
and Archbishops in the Anglican communion exercise leadership, and
some administrative authority (they chair synods, summon councils or
courts, and so on) but they do not exercise *authority* over other
Bishops. We rely on the authority of God, conscience, individual
Bishops -- and on our often slow and clumsy attempts to find
consensus. <BR><BR>The Anglican Church cannot &quot;return to the
Roman Catholic Church&quot; because it never left the *Roman*
Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church came into existence as a
separate distinction with the mutual and shameful excommunications of
Bishops in communion with either Rome or Canterbury sundered the
Catholic Church. Anglicans have repented of those ancient
excommunications, and consider them null. <BR><BR>The Archbishop of
Canterbury could submit to the authority of the Bishop of Rome, but
that would only bring *him* (and presumably those priests who are in
obedience to him) into communion with Rome. It would not restore the
catholicity of the Catholic Church, because the remaining umpteen
Anglican bishops would still, independently or through our awkward
and slow consensus-building process, have all to decide that they too
choose to abandon their Traditional independence. The probability of
that is remote in the extreme. <BR><BR>At least as remote as the
Bishop of Rome's abandoning his insistence on our Bishops
subordinating their independence to his claimed authority.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
