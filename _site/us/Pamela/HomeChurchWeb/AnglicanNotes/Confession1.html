<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I was raised
Catholic and my dh was raised Baptist. We realized we needed to find
a church, so we're &quot;trying out&quot;an Episcopalian one that we
plan on going to next weekend, with the goal of converting. Could you
answer a question I have about Episcopalian practices and beliefs
regarding reconciliation? We have confession in the Catholic church,
is this just a Catholic thing? This is one area that dh really had a
problem with. </FONT>

</P>
<P>There are several forms of confession used among Anglicans
(Anglican is what Episcopalians are called outside of the USA).
Corporate confession, is practiced at every liturgical service. It is
*not* the *sacrament* of reconciliation, but it is considered a
sufficient form of self-examination and preparation prior to
communion. If a priest is present, he or she may pronounce words of
absolution; but if a deacon or lay minister is leading the service he
or she will simply lead a corporate prayer for forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>However, Anglicans may also, if they choose, participate in
sacramental reconciliation. We say about the sacrament of confession
that &quot;all may, some should, none must&quot;. Very few Anglicans
confess regularly. Most seek the sacrament only a few times in their
lives (I have gone to confession twice: once the morning before my
wedding when I wanted a perfectly fresh start on my new life; and
once some years before when I had screwed up royally and sinfully).
And many Anglicans *never* make a sacramental confession. 
</P>
<P>If you do choose to make your confession, you call the church
office and make an appointment. There are usually no confessionals,
so the priest sits next to the altar inside the sanctuary. You come
at the appointed time, kneel at the altar rail, and 'fess up. The
priest will either have a card at the rail with your part of the
liturgy so that you can read it, or he'll tell you what to do and say
at that time. Then he'll proclaim absolution. 
</P>
<P>By the way, I am a convert -- from Atheism. I don't consider
converting from either the Roman Catholic denomination or the Baptist
denomination to really be a &quot;conversion&quot;. More an
expression of (good) taste and preference in worship style. The
Anglican communion recognises only one &quot;church&quot; -- the
whole company of Christ's people. I happen to think that the
Anglican/Episcopal style of worship and doctrine is the most
rewarding way to be part of that one church, but those misguided
souls &lt;grin&gt; whose personal taste leads them to follow Christ
in the context of other denominations are still part of Christ's
church. The weakness of the Anglican church is its tendency to
stuffiness and Establismentarianism; but in my experience that
weakness is outweighed by its historicity, beauty of worship, social
justice commitment, and ability to laugh at itself.
