<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">How as a Christian parent can we compete
with Elmo, and Blues Clues? I mean, we have Veggie Tales, but often I
don't see Veggie Tales telling the story of Jesus either. It is just
so disturbing to me that my kids know Elmo better than Jesus. I
figure if my 21mo old knows her alphabet, how to count, shapes, and
songs to all kinds of tunes including Elmo's World, she can learn the
toddler christian action songs! I mean come on people...the alphabet
song has as many phonetic syllables as the &quot;B I B L E&quot;
song! </FONT>
</P>
<P>I *think* my daughters know who Blue and Elmo are, but they've
never seen them on TV as far as I know. We very rarely have the TV
on. When they were preschoolers, TV was for sick days only, and then
it was usually pre-recorded. It's terribly difficult to break with
the TV. Either you're a work-outside-the-home mother, in which case
the day-home or before-and-after-school care probably uses at least
some TV; or you're a stay-at-home mother, in which case the TV may be
your life-line for preserving a sense of connectedness with the
outside world and for snatching those few private moments so you can
go to the bathroom alone. But, hard though it is, I'd recommend you
turn it off. 
</P>
<P>Start by refusing to compete with it. You wouldn't tolerate your
children's rudely interrupting you -- why tolerate it from a machine?
When you pick up that story-book to sit down with your little ones,
turn it off then. If you can, have it set up in a cupboard or
entertainment centre where you can close its doors and make it
invisible. Don't turn it on again unless someone asks, and then turn
it off the instant the current show is over. 
</P>
<P>Make sure you have high-play-value toys, and make sure they are
visible and accessible to your children. If your only play-room is
also your living room, sacrifice some of its formal look to
accommodate toy-shelves. Include dress-up clothes that can be used to
act out bible stories, and dolls or action figures that can be used
in the same way. Let them throw a table-cloth over a card-table to be
the tabernacle, or Abraham's tent. Have a set of play farm animals,
to be Moses' wife's flock, or the pigs that the prodigal son fed, or
Pharoahs horses. You may have to spend some time modelling this kind
of play for the children but, especially if you can *leave* the TV
off, they will soon learn to play by themselves. 
</P>
<P>Read, read, read. Forget about videos: there are few if any really
good ones; and they all have the flaw that they are essentially
non-interactive. But there are lots of beautifully-illustrated books.
Rural though you are, you have internet and that means you have
Amazon.com. Read, look at the pictures, and then use them as a
jumping-off point for imaginative play. Then once the play is going
well, extricate yourself so you can go do whatever you would have
done while the TV was on. 
</P>
<P>Rearrange your living arrangement so the play-area is adjacent to
your work-area. Then you can supervise while the children go about
their active play: you don't need to rely on the TV to &quot;keep
them occupied&quot; while you make dinner or pay the bills. And sing
as you go about your work. Don't drive yourself crazy: my children
never learned Christian children's action songs. They learned Sarum
plain-chant and nineteenth century camp-meeting songs. They had as
much fun with &quot;On Christ the Solid Rock I Stand&quot; (sung
while jumping from stone to stone in my rock garden -- oh, my poor
perennials&lt;g&gt;) as ever they've had with &quot;Seven Sons had
Father Abraham&quot;). And Trisagion is as easy as the B I B L E
song, and more tolerable when the hundredth iteration comes around.
If you don't sing, do it any way. God loves cheerful praise; he
doesn't care if it's off-key. If you still can't bring yourself to
sing, order some tapes and play them -- the ones *you* like. A
three-year-old lisping through Keith Green's &quot;Make my life a
prayer to You&quot; is just as charming as a three-year-old lisping
through &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;. 
</P>
<P>My children were born before the one-year maternity benefit came
into effect, so by the time they were 10 mo.s old I was back at work.
I was hungry for time with them by the end of each day. But I was
also tired, hungry, and stressed; as were they, and the TV seemed
awfully alluring at 5:00, offering the prospect of just a half hour
of mindlessness to adjust personas -- a half hour which if I gave in
would inevitably stretch out to all evening. I'm pretty bad at
playing, too. 
</P>
<P>But one thing I have just discovered that I wish I had discovered
when the girls were much younger is Matchbox cars. They even make
these plasticized fabric mats printed with roadways that you can
drive along. And if you spend a half hour in the matchbox/Hot Wheels
aisle of the toy store you start to see details that make certain
cars special. I was amazed at the range of detail and realism. It's
probably the only way I'll ever own a purple Lamberghini! It's not
too hard to lie on your tummy on the floor and push cars around while
you daydream -- and DS can lie beside you and push his cars around,
and you don't even have to talk, you can just listen to him.. 
</P>
<P>I also wish Flylady had been around ten years ago, or that I had
been born naturally organized: arranging toys prettily on shelves
where they can be easily found to play with, instead of piled into
rubbermaid bins, makes playing seem a lot more fun. And clearing off
two shelves of books to make room for a two-story Barbie house on the
cleared shelves was good, too. If I have to play, I can amuse myself
by rearranging the furniture while the girls lead the dolls through
their more complex activities. Maybe you can find some toys *you*
like to play with! 
</P>
<P>If you surround them with it, they will learn it. Just cut out the
competition. 
</P>
<P>My children are 7 and 10 now. They get about an hour of TV a week,
often less, occasionally more.
