<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">My husband is a christian and concerned for
my mortal soul. He wants us to go to church. I DON'T want to go to
church. However, I love him very much and if this lends peace to his
soul then so be it. When you looked for a church what did you look
for? Did you call and ask questions or actually visit? What questions
did you ask? I have an 15 yo, an 11 yo, and a 3 yo. What is
appropriate dress for church? </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Actually, you've chosen wisely an appropriate place to ask your
questions ...</P>
<P>I was raised atheist, and I have a deep appreciation of the
problem of &quot;knowing&quot; whether one believes. I am comforted
by the so-called &quot;agnostic's prayer&quot; from Luke: &quot;Lord,
I believe! Help thou my unbelief&quot;. Through your practice of
faith, such as regular and spontaneous prayer, and Bible-study, God
does help our unbelief. 
</P>
<P>The range of worship Christian churches is astonishing: from the
high liturgical tradition where the whole worship service is rigidly
scripted and chanted by trained clergy, to the pentecostal spirit
where worshippers move and pray as they feel led by the Spirit. So is
the range of superficial expectations: from the rare church where
women do practice &quot;covering&quot; their heads, never cut their
hair, and wear ankle-length skirts; to churches where jeans, bare
feet and tee-shirts are the norm. Most church-women wear hats only to
formal weddings, if they even own one; and consider a conservative
business suit perfectly appropriate. 
</P>
<P>A couple of years ago, I left my church-community and started
looking for another. For me, it was important to find a church where
children were treated as full members in Christ, and where baptism
and communion were maintained as holy (and efficacious) sacraments. I
also wanted to find a church where lay ministries were honoured, and
where outreach was part of the congregation's commitment to Christ. I
have to admit that, were the absence of hypocrisy one of my
requirements, I'd still be looking for a church. We the church have
the distinction, in these post-Constantinian times, of being both the
leaven *and* the lump. I look to my church community to have enough
of the leaven working in it, and try to find the resources to love
the lump in Jesus' name. 
</P>
<P>You will need to consider what sort of your church did your DH
grow up in? That will affect your decision. Believe me, a good
Baptist is not going to feel satisfied by worshipping in an Eastern
Orthodox church. Also consider, what sort of things might make
worship services tolerable, or even enjoyable to you? You can get
good phenomenology and textual-criticism-based teaching in some
churches, if that rigourous intellectual challenge is your thing. You
can soak up the ambiance of embroidered hangings and incense and
stained-glass if you love rich pageantry. Ancient chant or classical
organ music or up-beat guitar-and-drumkit praise? All options. Soup
kitchens and service projects, or bake-sales and bridge-clubs? 
</P>
<P>The questions that I asked were: Are children welcome in your
worship service? What facilities do you have to accomodate children?
Are children welcome to take communion? What is the pattern of your
worship service? Is your community welcoming to people in
non-traditional relationships? Do you have any support programs for
single mothers? 
</P>
<P>When you go to try out a church, dress conservatively but simply.
When you pick a church to try, you might ask again here, and someone
from that denomination can tell you what to expect. Ask whether there
is Sunday School or children's church during the service or at some
other time, and what ages it serves. Most churches pass an offering
plate: about $5 is a good &quot;just-visiting&quot; kind of offering.
Some churches have the custom of putting the offering in an envelope
so no-one knows how much you gave: check in the book-rack on the back
of the pew for envelopes. 
</P>
