<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">When celebrating Christmas with your
children, do you do the whole &quot;Santa Clause&quot; thing?  </FONT>
</P>
<P>We don't &quot;do&quot; Santa, but no shame to anyone who does ...</P>
<P>it just was never part of my husband's culture. It *was* part of
my childhood; but as I grew up atheist and converted in my twenties,
I am quite comfortable with many of the differences between my
childhood, and my children's. Santa isn't something I felt the need
to perpetuate. The Advent Wreath, Creche, Church Christmas Pageant,
and Midnight Mass take up our energy. Then Christmas itself lasts
twelve days, with multiple Christmas dinners and visitors (with
accompanying presents) nearly every day of the twelve. Santa doesn't
get missed! 
</P>
<P>I'm even *less* inclined to do the Easter Bunny thing! Between
Lenten disciplines, Palm Sunday Processions; Tenebrae; Maundy
Thursday services with foot-washing, Agape meal, Eucharist,
stripping-the-altar and vigil; Good Friday &quot;Way of the Cross&quot;
and Tre-Oro service; Holy Saturday Vigil and Midnight Mass;
Easter-Sunday sunrise service and extended family dinner (with hymns
and prayers); where would the poor little bunny find time to drop off
his baskets? 
</P>
<P>One essential &quot;change&quot; to the Santa myth, for those of
you that do it...</P>
<P>DON'T tell your children that &quot;Santa delivers toys to *every*
little girl and boy&quot;. 
</P>
<P>For one thing, that's a lie about all the families that don't have
Santa for religious or cultural reasons. The Christmas Angels fill my
Russian-heritaged children's shoes with sweets -- why would you
gratuitously misrepresent their culture? 
</P>
<P>For another thing, it's an easily detectable lie. All you need is
for your child to repeat it in the schoolyard to a Muslim or Jewish
child, and the other child will answer &quot;No, he doesn't. I never
get toys from Santa&quot;. And after they fight, and the school calls
you, you'll have to backtrack. 
</P>
<P>For a third thing, it glosses over the great neediness of millions
of children who not only don't get toys, but don't have enough food,
physical security, clean water, medical care, parents, or homes. I
think about a little girl in Rwanda that the Christian Blind Mission
missionary told me of, whose hands and feet were cut off by the
terrorists that massacred her family before her eyes. To have her
lumped by a myth in with happy laughing first world children enjoying
the overwhelming wealth of our economically advantaged society seems
offensive to me. Her needs so astronomically outweigh the &quot;need&quot;
of my DD9 for a new pair of skates under the tree. 
</P>
<P>Santa comes to little children all over the world -- that's true.
But not all children. If you introduce that idea early, it's easy to
explain &quot;Santa doesn't come to their house&quot;. The reasons
are easy, too: &quot;...because they're Jewish&quot;; &quot;...because
they don't want to be distracted from Christ's birth&quot;;
&quot;...because their country is so torn by war and poverty that
even Santa can't provide their needs; we have to do that as Christ's
hads and feet in the world&quot;. And so on.
