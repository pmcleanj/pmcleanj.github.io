<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">What is Pentecost? Being raised LDS this
certainly wasn't something we ever acknowledged. I know today we
celebrated the acsension and next Sunday is Pentecost, but I don't
know exactly what it is.  </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Pentecost is the celebration of the day that the Holy Spirit came
to the disciples. It is the fulfillment of Matthew 3:11, where John
the Baptist says &quot;I baptize you with water for repentance, but
he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not
worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with
fire.&quot; The story is in Acts 2. This is why it is customary to
wear red on Pentecost (representative of the flames.), and the altar
will be dressed in red. 
</P>
<P>That's the concise answer, so I get to ramble&hellip;</P>
<P>Pentecost gets its name from the Greek for &quot;50&quot;, being
the fiftieth day after the beginning of Passover. It was the second
in importance of the Jewish feasts, called the &quot;Feast of Weeks&quot;
or &quot;Feast of First-Fruits&quot;. We keep it 50 days after
Easter, and its importance for us as Christians derives from the
events Trish describes. For the early church, this was the watershed
between being disciples - students - of a master, fearful and lost in
that master's absence; and being Spirit-empowered leaders sent out to
bring good news to the world. It is, therefor, considered the
birthday of the Church. It is the third most important Holy Day,
after Easter and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>Because of the powerful images of the Holy Spirit coming to
indwell God's people, Pentecost is a traditional feast-day for
Baptisms, and more especially for Confirmation. It is sometimes
called Whitsunday (White Sunday) after the white dresses worn by
girls for their confirmation (an old custom now grown rare). Other
Baptismal festivals are Easter (of course), the Baptism of Our Lord
(first Sunday after Epiphany) and All Saints Day (November 1). 
</P>
<P>You probably know that the Church recapitulates the entire history
of Salvation in each Church Year. Starting with Advent (purple or
blue) we rattle rapidly through creation, the establisment and
Kingdom Israel, and the Prophets to the coming of the promised
Messiah at Christmas (white or gold). Epiphany (green) and Lent
(purple) take us through Jesus ministry. Passiontide (red, black, and
bare) takes us through the Crucifixion. Eastertide (white or gold)
and Ascension take us through the Resurrection. The day of Pentecost
(red) kicks off the long slow season of Pentecost (green - formerly
called the season of Trinity) which recapitulates the witness of the
Church through the ages. A nice custom is to change the hangings from
light green to darker more mature green at Lammastide (August 1),
halfway through the season. Finally, on the last Sunday of the year,
we celebrate Christ's triumph on Christ the King Sunday (white or
gold -- formerly green and called &quot;stir-up&quot; Sunday). 
</P>
<P>The liturgical colours are expressed through hangings (called
&quot;paramets&quot;) which may including any of: altar frontal,
superfrontal, bookmarks, curtains behind the altar, and hangings in
front of the lectern and pulpit. The colours have their own
symbolism: Purple for repentance and mourning, green for growth, blue
for creation, white and gold for purity and celebration, red for the
fire of the Spirit and the blood of the saints, black (rarely used)
for Good Friday and Ash Wednesday and rose pink (also rarely used)
for festivals of the blessed Virgin.
