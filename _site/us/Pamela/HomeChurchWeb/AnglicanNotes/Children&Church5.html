<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">We're building a
new parish hall, with a new nursery in it. There's been a large
donation specifically for the children's part of it. We can't
possibly spend it all on outfitting one small nursery. The rest is to
be spent on other aspects of </FONT>&quot;Children's Ministry&quot;.
Any ideas? 
</P>

</P>
<P>Definately get the Godly Play figures, although I lean also toward
more active toys like a ply-wood cut-out Noah's Ark with pairs of a
variety of stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>I'm inclined to say, if you have enough money for a piano, go for
it. But in practice, most Sunday Schools I've worked with haven't
used the piano that they've got. It's a good tool if you have a
formal children's choir, or if your Sunday School class sits and
stands in formal rows and the teacher sits at a distance to lead
them. In modern Sunday Schools the arrangement is more intimate and
informal and guitars are the more common lead instrument. Maybe a
guitar? It's just that the chance to provide a piano doesn't come
around as often as the chance to provide a guitar. 
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">How about commissioning a local
quilter to make some baby activity blankets on scriptural themes? You
can use them as wall-hangings in the nursery when they're not in use,
and have the additional advantage that parents can borrow them to
take their babies into church if you ever get to that point in your
inclusivity (see, I'm 'way more radical than you!) You want images
that allow you to use a lot of different textures and shapes.</SPAN></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P> The Tree in the Garden is traditionally drawn with every
	kind of fruit from the same tree, so the quilter can applique shapes
	of velvet and satin. Animals in the garden can be made of fun-fur,
	and leaves or bushes can make flaps or pockets that an animal or
	fruit can hide behind or in (firmly teathered by a strong,
	well-stitched cord. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The Ark with its collection of animals is another invitation
	to use different textures, and a couple of velcro-down port-holes
	lets the quilter hide &quot;surprises&quot; for baby. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The Nativity lets her use wooly fabric for the little lambs,
	yarn or deep pile for the hay, rough fabric for the shepherds'
	clothes and fine fabric for the Virgin, and so on. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Some other images that would work well could be &quot;The
	City of God&quot; with a fountain in the centre and streets of gold
	lame, &quot;The peacable Kingdom&quot; with the lion laying down
	with the lamb and the child playing over the adder's nest, maybe
	Baby Moses in his basket of rushes. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>I'd go for quite small -- big enough that a baby can roll over
without rolling off, but not so big as to take up an awkward amount
of space in a small nursery or meeting-room. Any choke-hazards have
to be triple-stitched for safety. Appliques should be big, bold and
simplistic: one furry lamb rather than three more intricate ones, for
example. 
</P>
<P>Maybe a separate space for preschoolers? It's hard for pre-k kids
to sit through church, but the *nursery* isn't the place for them.
One church in Toronto made a space for preschoolers by removing two
front pews and putting in their place a deep-pile oriental carpet so
small children could sit in comfort instead of squirming in too-hard
too-big pews, and still participate in the worship life of the
church. 
</P>
<P>Preschoolers can and do sit through a full service if they feel
welcome and included and have their needs met. Their needs include
somewhat more movement than adults. This need can be met in several
ways: providing a carpet or less structured space than narrow rows of
pews; having a policy of allowing children to move quietly from one
welcoming snuggle to another; inviting children to come sit in the
chancel during the sermon, baptisms, consecration and/or a special
&quot;children's lesson&quot;; offering liturgical toys or colouring
activities that can occupy the children during the sermon. (It's
*very* helpful, too, if the preacher can say something like &quot;put
your crayons away now, the sermon's over&quot; just the same way he
gives liturgical instructions like &quot;please stand&quot; and &quot;you
may be seated&quot; to the adults). 
</P>
<P>Puppets, now, are a wonderful aid for children's lessons and even
-- if you have a particularly talented preacher -- as a sermon aid. 
</P>
<P>And I have always had a yearning to do a flannel-graph altar
frontal, so that someone could put up illustrations in felt of the
bible lesson. Arranging the flannel icons could be done either before
church or during the readings themselves -- or even during the
children's lesson if you have one. Children (and adults, but we being
more sophisticated hide our boredom better) engage better with the
word if there is also a visual focus. Children's bibles have great
illustrations; I'm sure there are ways to capture the power of those
illustrations to aid listening to the lectionary. Stained glass
windows do it, but any one church can handle only a few windows, and
there are 89 books in the bible to be illustrated!
