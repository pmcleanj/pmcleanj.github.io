<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I converted  to
Catholicism when I married, but I have never felt at home in any RC
church. The singing is lifeless, and my children don't get anything
out of the service.  I have resisted putting my youngest son (9) in
any formal religious education and he has not had his &quot;first
communion&quot; yet, as I didn't feel he was ready at the age of 7. I
want to try a local non-denominational church, but my husband is
against it. Do you have any advice for me? </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Saint Augustine wrote &quot;Man is restless, 'til he find his rest
in Thee&quot;. If you run away from your present parish, you will
only be carrying your restlessness with you. I think you need to dig
more deeply into your own spirituality, and into the opportunities
the Roman Catholic church offers to feed it. 
</P>
<P>Did you take RCIA when you converted? If not, or if in retrospect
you don't feel it was deep enough, look into an inquirer's class for
adult Catholics, or an instructional retreat like Cursillo. There is
great breadth and depth to Catholicism, and you do not need to leave
Catholicism to find house groups, charismatic worship, rousing
singing, or whatever worship style it is that would allow you to
express your heart for worship. But first, you need to know your own
heart -- and that means you may need to explore yourself. 
</P>
<P>Admittedly, the average RC parish church does make Anglicans seem
like hearty singers (nothing else could LOL!). It can be pretty sad.
On the other hand, a Lutheran congregation belting out traditional
Lutheran chorale in four-part harmony makes Anglicans seem pretty
sad, so it's a matter of where you're coming from. You can prime your
children to sing with you by singing hymns and choruses around the
house. I sing the Canticles of morning and evening prayer to my
children nearly every day, Dean (who sings in the worship team at our
church) sings the music for the coming Sunday as he drives children
to ballet and Tae-kwondo, and we regularly sing Table-grace and other
prayers. It's easier for children to sing when the music and words
are familiar. (And since, at the moment, we're attending a Lutheran
church, they're becoming familiar with four-part harmony they blow
away their Anglican brethren, LOL!) 
</P>
<P>I would strongly encourage you to allow your younger son to
receive communion. I presume that you have been received into
communion by the Roman Catholic church and receive communion there
yourself? Since communion is deeply spiritual, a true feeding of the
soul rather than a rational symbolic exercise, mature understanding
is not a pre-requisite. What children get out of it, even at a *very*
young age, is experiential evidence of their adoption into God's
household, their full membership alongside their parents and friends,
the deep reality of their *belonging* in that place. My five-year-old
part-time-son, denied communion because his Pastor believed children
should be &quot;old enough to understand&quot;, told us on the way
home from Church &quot;Anne and Rachel and you are part of God's
family, but I'm not.&quot; When I assured him that he was, he said
&quot;Oh yeah? Then how come I didn't get the Holy Bread? Cause I'm
*not*!&quot; 
</P>
<P>Similarly, I would encourage you to allow him to attend Mass with
you. &quot;Children's Church&quot; and Sunday-School are still
relatively uncommon among Roman Catholic parishes here, and I find it
unfortunate that they are becomming more common. There is a great
deal more to mass than the sermon, and children drink in the visual
symbols in the surroundings, the language of the readings and liturgy
with its extensive use of Scripture, the prayerfulness of their
fellow worshippers and the sanctity of the experience. You can
&quot;leverage&quot; these things by preparing for Mass during the
week ahead: use the link I just posted above, read the lessons aloud
to your children or have them read them aloud, and maybe do some of
the activities. Children focus better when they recognise familiar
material. Since the homily is usually based on the lectionary, that
should help you get even more out of the sermon, and if you discuss
the lessons over the dinner table even your husband will get some
benefit from your work. 
</P>
<P>Another thing we use, is &quot;Sermon Summaries&quot; -- a
Lutheran custom I borrowed from two of Anne's godparents. I use the
half-blank, half-lined notebooks. The children are allowed to draw,
colour or write in them during the sermon. Usually, they end up
drawing Christian symbols, often symbolic or illustrative of the
sermon subject. At 13, your elder son should be able to produce
critical precis of the homily for discussion over lunch, but if he
doesn't want to do that I wouldn't push. Just give him the option and
be willing to listen to and discuss his ideas arising from the
sermon. 
</P>
<P>Also, try going to some additional services. They may have
different music, or a different subset of the congregation attending,
or a different focus to the homily. Attending the particular Lutheran
church that we attend, I rarely get &quot;fed&quot; to the point that
I'm satisfied -- but lunch-hour eucharists, and special services at a
different parish on holy-days, and the occasional Sunday-evening
eucharist or Vespers keeps me going. I'd rather be at an
Anglo-catholic parish. But on Sunday morning I *have* to be where the
needs of my husband and children are met -- and use some creativity
to make sure my needs are met in other ways.
