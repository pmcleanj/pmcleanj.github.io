<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">I was just curious if there were different
types of Episcopal churches. Do you know? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>&quot;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials liberty; in all
things love...&quot;</P>
<P>I may have mangled that quote a little, but it is the essence of
Anglicanism (Episcopals are part of the Anglican communion). The root
difference between the Roman Catholic church, and the other churches
within the catholic tradition, is that our Bishops are equal and
independant of human authority, having responsibility directly to
God. They maintain unity by prayerful consensus -- sometimes more
successfully than others. As a result, the Anglican Communion enjoys
much greater diversity than is seen in a church where a strong
central hierarchy maintains control over the forms used by the
church. 
</P>
<P>Within the Anglican tradition, several general groups thrive,
based on their historical roots. The biggest difference
*theologically* are the schizmatic Anglicans who have broken
communion with the rest of the Anglican communion over liturgical
reform (i.e. the introduction of new or revised prayer books), or the
ordination of women, or the attitude toward homosexuality, or
intercommunion with other denominations. 
</P>
<P>Among those who are *in* communion, the biggest differences are
differences of style. &quot;High Church&quot; Anglicans retain as
much ceremony as possible, in some cases borrowing from the Roman
Catholic church additional ceremonials that developed in that
denomination after the Reformation. &quot;Low Church&quot; Anglicans
lean heavily on the influences of the Puritans and Calvinists on
Catholic thought: their services though liturgical may be devoid of
&quot;extras&quot; like incense, candles, and paraments.
&quot;Evangelical&quot; Anglicans are similar to Low Church
Anglicans, with a special emphasis on personal witness and scriptural
reliance and a de-emphasis on episcopal authority, Tradition, and
Reason. &quot;Celtic Christians&quot; draw on the pre-Roman
traditions that were brought to Ireland and Scotland in the first and
second century after Christ, long *before* the Establishment and
legalisation of the Church by the Roman Emperor -- they use rich
ceremonial and symbolism but with a very different style from the
Roman style and with a strong dose of mysticism. Because a hundred
years ago Anglican Christianity was the state religion of an Empire
on which the sun never set, there are also many Anglican churches
around the world: African and Asian immigrants often bring their own
flavour of Anglicanism to America, where it may be integrated into
the spectrum of the Episcopal church. And &quot;Charismatic&quot;
Anglicans value the living witness of the Holy Spirit in much the way
that Pentecostals do -- speaking in tongues, dancing in worship, and
prophesying. 
</P>
<P>Then, we have the variety that comes from our different liturgical
language. Most Anglican provinces (all except the U.S., in fact)
retain some form of the Book of Common Prayer of 1662. This is the
language that is somewhat retained in your (I think) Rite I. Most
provinces also offer some alternative forms of liturgy, in either a
Book of Alternative Services as in Canada, or the book of Common
Worship in the UK, or in the U.S. subsumed into your 1979 prayerbook
as Rite II. Most &quot;High Church&quot; parishes use the traditional
language and chant &quot;The Lord be with Thee/And with Thy Spirit&quot;.
Most &quot;Low Churches&quot; use more modern language and say &quot;The
Lord be with you/And also with you&quot;. But some churches who use
incense, light votive candles, have elaborate hangings and celebrate
Saints days *also* use modern language. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>Apart from that, we're all exactly alike ;-).
