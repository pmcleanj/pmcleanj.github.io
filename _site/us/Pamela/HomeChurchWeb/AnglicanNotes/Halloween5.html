<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">How do other Christians handle Halloween? It
seemed like such an innocent thing until I became a Christian . </FONT>Our
small group at church did a websearch on &quot;halloween and
christianity&quot;, and found many articles like this one:
www.jeremiahproject.com/halloween.html <FONT COLOR="#280099"> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Just as I keep &quot;Christ&quot; in Christmas, I keep the
&quot;Hallow&quot; in Hallowe'en...</P>
<P>It's the same word, &quot;Hallow&quot;, as in &quot;Hallowed be
Thy Name&quot;, and it means Holy. It's a Christian Holiday. As we
have done every year, we will go to church on All Hallows to
commemorate the witness of the Faithful departed. We'll undertake
some sort of maintenance work at the cemetary -- even if only
bringing flowers to some lonely grave. And we'll learn the stories of
some of the great Christian witnesses of the past. 
</P>
<P>Socio-archeologists speculate with some certainty; that
Hallowe'en, like Christmas, Lady-day, Michaelmas and Candlemas; was
established by early Christian missionaries to Northern Europe, on
the date of some previously-existing celebration. That knowledge has
allowed modern Pagans to reconstruct some of the probable festivals
of the ancient pagan religion. For me that doesn't change the fact
that hundreds of generations of faithful Christians have used this
day as a special celebration of the fellowship that living Christians
share with those who have gone before us into God's nearer presence. 
</P>
<P>Pumpkins, costumes, and sweets have little more to do with
Hallowe'en than Santa Claus, Macy's parade, and turkey dinner have to
do with Christmas. A little more, because the costumes recollect for
us the passion plays that kept alive the stories of Christian
witnesses and martyrs in the days before the printing press when most
believers were illiterate. And the squash and winter vegetables
(traditional fall-harvest lanterns were made in hollowed-out turnips,
not pumpkins: the pumpkin is a new-world vegetable) that were
harvested at this time would be the staple food for the impending
winter -- a winter that many of the presently celebrating Christians
would not survive in those days before nutritional substitutes and
indoor heating. In the following year, they would be remembered by
those whom the winter vegetables did sustain. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All Hallows became a Christian day of
remembrance throughout the &quot;known&quot; world in the first half
of the ninth century, and has been celebrated as such every year
since, right up to this year. Well over half the world's Christians
-- a billion-plus people -- love and honour it as a major holy day. 
</P>
<P>I believe the actual start of the festival relates to the sun's
position being halfway between the autumnal equinox (mid-fall) and
the winter solstice (mid-winter), making this date the cross-over (or
cross-quarter) from Fall into Winter. Since there is only one Sun,
and the whole world has noticed it, there is a tendency for different
cultures to establish holidays on the same day. 
</P>
<P>There is no good archeological evidence for the *reason* that Pope
Gregory moved the feast of All Saints from May 13 to Nov 1. His
ostensible reason -- the one documented historically -- was to
celebrate the dedication on that day of the Chapel of All Saints in
the Vatican Basilica. My theory is that northern European Christians
were celebrating the end of Harvest on that day anyway, and he wanted
to accomodate their culture and tradition within the Church. But the
official reason was a chapel dedication far away in south Europe, so
my theory may be as much smoke and hot air as the &quot;trying to
stamp out Samhain&quot; theory -- but it sound nicer. 
</P>
<P>History actually tells us very little about pagan rituals at all,
let alone rituals associated with Halloween. Modern Wiccans have had
to rely on dubious oral tradition and christian literature to
reconstruct their religion. Documents like Malleus Maleficarum
(written by Christians but far from Christian in their lack of love
and compassion)made hideous claims about witches that, according to
the hard research of history, were based entirely on medaeivel
Christian paranoia. Not only is there no historical evidence
supporting the claims made in these documents, there is considerable
historical evidence against them. 
</P>
<P>Ungrounded fear affects the secular aspect of Halloween, too. Do
you know that every claim of tainted candy that has been thouroughly
investigated, has turned out to be fraudulent? We are scaring
ourselves without cause. Wicca *has* become more popular in recent
years, -- but the truth about Wicca has actually *helped* a little to
clean up some of the fear of secular Halloween -- and thanks to those
Wiccans who are vocally discounting the ridiculous legends of our
past. And it is rarely the Wiccans who are dressing up as demons and
undead -- *they* are at circle that night, or taking their toddlers
around the neighbourhood dressed as ballerinas and spiderman, just as
the Christians are. 
</P>
<P>Personally &lt;g&gt;, I think we should blame the horrible
costumes on rebellious teenagers and bad mothers -- it's
tradition&lt;g&gt;. 
</P>
<P>There are many such links such as the Jeremiah Project on the
world wide web...</P>
<P>They do not constitute scholarly research. However, I am hearing
college professors beginning to complain that some students have lost
the skill of doing non-Internet-based secondary research, so some
clarifications may be in order: 
</P>
<P>No claims in any field, whether web-published or paper-published,
have any validity unless they are backed up by references to other
reputable publications, which eventually reference primary research.
Primary research means you yourself read the original vellums, or
counted the pottery sherds in the midden. Mere publication does not
make a paper or page reliable; look for detailed references
(footnotes and bibliography) to *primary* sources, publication in
peer-adjudicated scholarly journals, and reputable (and attributed)
authorship with scholarly redentials. 
</P>
<P>The site you referenced claims that the Druids stopped sacrificing
humans in bonfires in the 1600's!!! Do you know anything else about
the 1600's? The claims of human-sacrificing Druids operating freely
in the century after the reformation are utterly unbelievable -- this
is hardly ancient history. It isn't even medaeivel! The site *does*
have more than the usual proportion of verifiable fact mixed in with
its less reasonable claims, but I wouldn't call it reliable history.
Though you are certainly right that there are many more, just as bad
if not worse. And there are plenty of paper publications just as bad.
