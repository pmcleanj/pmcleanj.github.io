<P><FONT COLOR="#280099"><FONT SIZE=4>Question:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Something I never thought about -- funerals
for killers...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">...I've only been to a couple of funerals in
my life and all but 2 were for folk who died of old age. The other
two were an accident victim and a guy who died in Vietnam. This
Sunday our choir is singing at the funeral for the son of a couple
who are members not of my church, but of our sister church. Tuesday
night, this young man (he was 25) shot and killed his wife, then
killed himself. Apparently, they were arguing about drinking. As far
as I know, neither one were members of the church, but most likely he
was raised in that church. (Understand that we have only been
attending our church for a few months so we don't know everyone well
and have no memories of their grown-and-gone children, particularly
those from the sister church.) </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Anyway, it just seems a bit strange to me,
and I wonder what the service will be like. All the others I've
attended were for people who were active members who, so far as
anyone knew, had no major &quot;sins&quot; in their lives. This one
is different. It makes me wonder...When people are executed for
crimes, do their families collect the bodies and take them home to be
buried? Do they have services for them? What do they say? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">We humans have such difficulty with
forgiveness-- we know we *ought* to forgive, but we often can't bring
ourselves to do it. I'm glad it's not up to us! I'm also glad I'm not
the minister who has to deal with the issue. I'm not sure I could
find anything to say other than platitudes, as such things are so far
beyond my comprehension. It's such a fine line to walk between
seeming to condone what has been done and recognizing that most of us
have, at one time or another, felt the urge to do something so
drastic. We can only be thankful that we had the strength to resist
and not take that path. Maybe that's *why* we have such difficulty
with forgiveness-- because we *have* resisted those urges and can't
understand why someone else couldn't resist, also. In the end, I
guess it's not up to us to forgive, that is God's domain, because-- I
suppose-- God *does* understand what drives people to such ends. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Our lot seems to be to comfort the living,
which is what funerals are about in our culture. That's a much easier
job, as we can all empathize with how much it hurts to lose a child,
regardless of the circumstances. Today, I give my ds extra hugs, and
pray that he will never find himself without the strength to resist
evil, that he will never do something so final it can't be fixed,
only survived</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">One benefit of a Common liturgy...</P>
<P>is that minister doesn't have to find anything to say. I have
commented ironically before that I would like to revert to Islam just
before I die so I could have a civilized funeral: Muslims believe
that, as we are all brought utterly equal in death, so every funeral
is completely equal. There are no fancy caskets to compare to plain
pine boxes, no elequent eulogies to compare to forced platitudes. The
prayer and worship are all. 
</P>
<P>The traditional Anglican service has no place in it for a sermon
or eulogy. Most Anglican clergy insert one in keeping with North
American cultural practice. I don't think it adds anything. The
greater part of the liturgy is straight from the Bible anyway;
there's not much you can add to that in the face of the terrible
absoluteness of any death. 
</P>
<P>There simply *are* no words for some experiences; for some depths
of feeling. In those circumstances, the Spirit gives us words to
pray. I suspect one of the reasons glossalalia is as rare as it is
among Anglicans is that the Spirit has already given us the wonderful
prayer-language of our liturgies. Where the pentecostal finds
expression for the unspeakable by crying out in tongues, the Anglican
finds herself chanting &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. In this case, that is
very appropriate: &quot;Oh Lamb of God, have mercy upon us, have
mercy upon us, grant us Thy peace.&quot;
