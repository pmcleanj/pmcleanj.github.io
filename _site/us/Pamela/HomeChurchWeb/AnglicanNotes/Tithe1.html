<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#280099">I was just saved
last Sunday, and that day, our pastor gave a sermon about money that
really hit home. My husband and I are in an increasingly worse
financial situation. We have a six-week old baby, and I was fired in
January for being pregnant. I just went through my bills, and
realized that my gas is about to be shut off (probably today), and we
will be without hot water and air conditioning, with a six-week old
baby in the house. And, the rest of my bills (utilties and credit
cards) are all very late. We can barely keep up with rent and
groceries, much less the other bills. </FONT> <FONT COLOR="#280099">I
got myself into debt a few years ago, and ruined my credit history,
and I can't even open a bank account where I can cash my unemployment
cheques. How can I tithe?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Now, right now, call the YWCA
and ask them to hook you up with a financial counsellor. </SPAN>The
one thing that ALWAYS happens when you begin tithing, is you have 10%
less money to be responsible for. Yes, many people are blessed by
that -- I tithe, and it is a blessing -- but many of those who are
blessed by tithing are living a good deal above bare necessity. 
</P>
<P>Give to God ... but no responsible pastor would be demanding 10%
of your income when you're facing having no hot water to wash your
infants nappies! A pastor -- a true shepherd of the sheep -- would be
offering to stand beside you at the washtub scrubbing the baby-shit
out of them. 
</P>
<P>There's an awful lot in your post, and a financial counsellor
would help you make plans and consider options that you should be
considering before your unemployment insurance runs out. The reason I
suggest the YWCA is that 1) they are Christian; 2) they don't have a
vested interest in convincing you that you should tithe; 3) they do
have a vested interest in addressing women's problem's and many of
your financial struggles are specifically problems that women face. 
</P>
<P>A good financial counsellor will help you get your cheques cashed.
Financial regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In
general, the bank ***on which a cheque is drawn*** *is obliged* to
pay, in cash, the value of the cheque to the original payee. You
could then just deposit the cash to your husband's account. Also in
general, all banks must pay out all government cheques to the
original payee, and you could hand over the cash. In both cases, you
would probably have to show picture I.D., but the bank may not refuse
to pay you. But a local financial counsellor can help you better than
an internet stranger who doesn't even know where you live. 
</P>
<P>A financial counsellor might convince you that you'd be better off
with your own drawing account, and help you set one up that's
convenient. Credit Unions are a good option when banks fail you. 
</P>
<P>A financial counsellor might also help you find more efficient
ways to cope with the costs of running a household that includes a
baby. Many of those compromises *do* involve hard work (like using
cloth nappies instead of disposables; connecting with a community
kitchen to decrease food costs, and so on) but I get the sense you
are willing to dig in and do what needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>Finally, a financial counsellor might help you negotiate financial
priorities with your DH in a way that doesn't leave you and your baby
vulnerable to spending decisions he might make. That may involve
seeking compensation for your firing -- most jurisdictions don't
allow employers to fire without just cause, and pregnancy in and of
itself isn't just cause -- or considering ways that you can return to
work. 
</P>
<P>God's Law never requires that we give to the point of harming
ourselves or others, particularly if the others include a tiny baby
who might go without necessities. Instead, consider offering tithes
of time, prayer, and of the work of your hands; by volunteering at
the church or in the service of prisoners, widows, orphan and the
poor.
