<P>f<FONT COLOR="#280099"> you do not believe Adam and Eve were real
people, then do you believe....m</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">that God created the earth? That there was a
world-wide flood? That the children of Isreal were slaves in Egypt?
That Esther was made a queen? That Job went through all of his
trials? That David had an affair? That part of the book of Daniel,
and most of Revelation are symbolic? That Jesus was the Son of God?
That Jesus rose from the dead? That He can save us from sin and take
us to heaven? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">If you believe any or all of these things,
then how can you not take Genesis literally? The Bible says these
things happened. If you believe part of the Bible, why not believe it
all? Aside from the parts that are obviously symbolic, because they
say basically that, why do you doubt any of it? Why believe any of
it, if part of God's word is not true? If you don't take all the
Bible as truth, then how do you decide what's real, and what's not?
If the parts that specify they're symbolic aren't the only symbolic
parts, how do you decide what else is? Don't try to be logical. God's
love for us is not logical, yet you believe in it, right? Why does he
love us, when we are so horrible to him? Why would he give his ONLY
SON for us, when we treat him the way we do? Could you give up your
child for someone who hates you? That is not logical. That, to me, is
far more illogical than believing that the entire human race came
from just two people. </FONT>

<P>In answer to your first paragraph...</P>
<P>yes, no, maybe, no opinion, no, maybe, mumble, yes, yes, and
mumble; in that order. Note that mumble is a technical
computer-programmer's term meaning &quot;you have worded the question
in a way that renders the answer undefined&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I don't doubt any of the Bible. I accept it all as inspired,
conveying a message of complex layered meanings, any of which may at
the appropriate time help in bringing me into a closer relationship
with God. It comprises multiple literary forms, including poetry,
mythic history, novels, dynastic history, hymnody, and others. None
of the literary forms it contains is commensurate with a modern
western history text, and it is an abuse of the original text to
treat it as such. 
</P>
<P>The Bible is not a single document. It is a set of documents -- in
fact, a set of sets of documents, differently compiled by different
Christian groups. You say, if you believe part of the Bible, why not
believe it all? Yet, I warrant, you do not believe the book of Judith
or Tobit... do you? Roman Catholics don't accept the books of Esdras,
although Anglicans do. Jerome did not accept the book of Didache,
although second-century Christians did. Luther did not accept the
book of Hebrews or Revelation. Some third-century Christians accepted
the Gospel of Thomas, but some did not. Finally, most protestants
accepted the sixty-nine books in the translation sponsored by the
protestant King of England, simply because he had the financial
resources to publish the edition and put it into the hands of the
majority of protestants; and they accepted it without asking too hard
how the decision was made which books to include and which to leave
out. I mention this because Biblical literalism rests firmly on that
very question *not* being asked. If you do ask it, how do you answer
it? By claiming that the King James version was inspired over other
translations or collections, as some literalists do? If so, where in
Scripture do you find reference to the King James version, or to the
69-book canon? 
</P>
<P>I don't have to *try* to be logical. God made me that way. I won't
deny the gift of a sharp mind and skeptical thinking, or try to turn
those off. I won't close my eyes for fear of asking a question God
can't handle. Scripture teaches us to examine everything. 
</P>
<P>The creation myth in Genesis is beautiful. It teaches us about
God's personal love; that we are animated by God's own breath within
us, that God would kneel and do manual labour in the red river-clay
to mold us with God's own hands rather than just bringing about our
existance by fiat as with all the other animals. As long as this
speaks powerfully to me of God's care, why do you care whether I
point out that a literal unitary &quot;Mother of Mankind&quot;
requires an abrogation of currently-observed genetic behaviour? 
</P>
<P>If you require a literal interpretation to believe, feel free --
my eight-year-old provided the out for you. But do understand that
many critical thinkers are alienated from Christ by the inference
that they will have to choose between belief and intellect. For them,
the suggestion that they should stop being logical is a stumbling
block -- one that literalists often unwittingly throw in their way;
followed by bemusement as to why they &quot;choose&quot; not to
accept Christ. Now -- hold on to your hat -- Christianity is *NOT*
about the bible. It's about Christ. And if your insistance on
Biblical Literalism comes between someone and Christ, it's not
*Christ's* work you are doing thereby. 
</P>
<P>I know I worded the above pretty strongly, and I hope *you* aren't
offended, since you did ask for the answers. I felt that you put
words in my mouth by suggesting that I pick and choose from scripture
or put myself in judgement over God by demanding that God's actions
be &quot;logical; and that you asked me to defend, or apologise for,
my (orthodox) views. 
</P>
<P>I do understand that literalists believe the bible to be inerrant
and literally factual; that they consider &quot;factual&quot; and
&quot;true&quot; to be synonyms; that by &quot;the Bible&quot; they
mean the 69-book canon; that they consider the inerrancy of the bible
to take precedence over academic or critical analysis; that some
extend these claims specifically to a single translation based on the
claim that translation is &quot;inspired&quot;; that for some
believing or disbelieving the Bible is equivalent to accepting or
rejecting Christ; that literalists generally come from
congregationalist sects or denominations that emphasise personal
reliance on scripture and therefor there are wide variations in the
individual beliefs and understanding of biblical literalists. Is
there more to understand? 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I<FONT COLOR="#280099"> do not read the
King James version of the Bible, because it was translated by men who
were biased. They worked for the king, and translated accordingly. I
do know of the books that are included in the Catholic Bible, but
have never read them, so I have no opinion of them. I would be
willing to read them, however. I will try to repond to any questions
you ask in the future, as far as I know or can find the answer. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Now, then, you believe God created the
heavens and the earth, correct? That is what Genesis 1:1 says. So you
take that literally. Do you then take Genesis 1:2 literally? If so,
when does it become myth? If not, how can you take 1:1 literally? It
is inconsistent to take Genesis 1:1 literally, but say the whole of
Genesis is symbolic. How do you decide what is real, and what is
myth? </FONT>
</P>
<P>I'm reassured to hear that you are open to accepting all of these
as &quot;Bible&quot;. That is consistent with insisting that one
believe the &quot;whole&quot; and with not having a reason to limit
the &quot;whole&quot; to 66. But be warned, it is a slippery slope.
Just as you are trying to force me to declare a line between what I
accept, as you call it, &quot;literally&quot; and what I accept as
mythic truth; wherever you draw the line between what writings are
&quot;in&quot; and what are &quot;out&quot;, someone &lt;me, if
no-one else does it--g&gt; will pull up a related document and ask
why you don't believe that one. If Tobit is in, why no Esdras? If
Esdras, why not the Shepherd of Hermes? If Hermes, why not the Nicene
creed and other statements of the first Nicene council? If Nicea, why
not Thomas? If Thomas, why not Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>I am also reassured that you do not ascribe to
King-James-Version-Only-ism. But all bible translators are fallible
men, all have their own biases, and for the most part they get paid
by someone. Zondervan and Oxford University Press also have their own
agendas (two name two of the most popular bible publishing houses).
Denominational translators such as the Watch Tower society, obviously
reflect the doctrinal bias of their denomination. So what bible can
you not discount as the result of biased men? Torah, of course, if
you read Hebrew; but what of the New Testament? Even the most ancient
texts in the original Greek show variant wordings: which one of the
variants do you take literally? 
</P>
<P>You believe it is important to take Genesis literally, so that you
have a solid foundation for your faith. But my faith is not founded
on the Bible. It is founded on a personal relationship with God. I
believe God created the Heavens and the Earth because that is
consistent with God as I know &quot;Him&quot;. I know God by spending
time with God in prayer and meditation (including meditation on
Scripture, which is not dependent on taking Scripture literally). I
know that this &quot;Other&quot; with whom I am spending time is God,
because older Christians bore witness to me of who God is; and my
experience of the Other is consistent with their witness. The ways in
which older Christians (and Patriarchs) witness to me include
personal encounter, art, poetry, Tradition, and their witness as
recorded in the Bible. This is the God who befriends fallible,
limited humans; and through our fallibility allows our efforts to
suffice. The Biblical witness to God is also fallible and human, but
it too suffices. 
</P>
<P>In the same vein, your 5-year-old probably shows some of the same
traits you do. That is where the Theory of Evolution starts. Yet
though you accept that, you are not constrained to accept the entire
Theory of Evolution, because agreeing with a high-level statement is
not the same as agreeing with a detailed mechanistic description. In
the same way, I can agree with the high-level description that God
created the Heaven and the Earth, without agreeing that Genesis 1-3
is the engineering manual describing God's methodology. 
</P>
<P>Or, consider that the phrase &quot;I believe in God the Father
Almighty&quot; is the first line of the Nicene Creed. (Credal
statements have greater historicity than the Bible, and much greater
historicity than the doctrine of literal inerrancy.) You accept the
first line of the Nicene Creed, but I do not assert that you are
thereby constrained to accept all of the three historic creeds. 
</P>
<P>Furthermore, I have said all along that I accept Genesis as Mythic
Truth. I accept Genesis 1.1 as Mythic Truth, too. In high-level vague
statements, the distinction between Mythic Truth and literalism
vanishes. I suggest that you lack the grounds to decide that my
acceptance of Genesis 1.1 is &quot;literal&quot; rather than &quot;mythic&quot;
-- so this is another case of putting words into my mouth. 
</P>
<P>Give my regards to your dh, and tell him an utter stranger on the
internet considers him to be a perspicacious gentleman&lt;g&gt;.
However, I have some experience of aggressive conservatives trying to
force me to abandon my own personal experience of Divine for theirs.
I no longer allow that behaviour to offend me, even when -- as has
happened &lt;g&gt; -- they call me a tool of Satan whom God will spit
out of God's mouth on the day of judgement. Please understand that
the second-hand experience of a stranger on the internet cannot
convince me to over-ride my own direct experience of the Divine. If
you live with that, if you are really interested in understanding my
perspective beyond the goal of changing it, then I am content to
continue the discussion.
