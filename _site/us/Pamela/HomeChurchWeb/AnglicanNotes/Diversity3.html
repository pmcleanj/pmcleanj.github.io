<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">I have questions on two different subjects 
-- one more touchy than the other. First, regarding Yoga: is it just
exercise, or is it a non-Christian spiritual exercise?  Second, with
the Girl Scouts'  openly accepting leaders who practice, should I
quit and pull my daughter out? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>I have answers on two subjects -- one more touchy than the other
&lt;g&gt;!</P>
<P>Yoga is founded in Vedantist (Hindu) philosophy, and embodies the
idea that body and mind, or spirit, are part of the same unified
whole. This philosophy stands with orthodox Christianity against the
heresy of gnosticism that has plagued the Christian church for
millenia. As such it is perfectly consistent for a Christian to study
yoga. I can post references to the scriptures, if you would like. 
</P>
<P>However, some Christians are very sensitive to any taint of
syncretism (the reconciling or combining of different beliefs with
Christianity). Those Christians should avoid yoga because of its
association with another religion. If syncretism *doesn't* bother
you, there's no reason to worry about this unless it harms another
Christians faith. Saint Paul writes about these ideas in the Book of
Romans. I can post the references but Romans is a short book, and it
doesn't take long to read the whole thing to get the full context. 
</P>
<P>As for &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot;, well, I live in a
secular country. For most of my countrymen, daily prayer, worship and
bible study are an &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;. As a Brownie
leader, I'm glad that the Girl Guides are tolerant of *my* peculiar
lifestyle. Besides, if the Girl Guides banned leaders who didn't
completely conform, they wouldn't have enough leaders to run: the
single parent lifestyle, working parents, and singleness are all
&quot;alternative&quot; compared to the standard married stay-at-home
mothers who were my Brownie, Guide and Ranger leaders decades ago.
Baden-Powell himself was no conformist!
