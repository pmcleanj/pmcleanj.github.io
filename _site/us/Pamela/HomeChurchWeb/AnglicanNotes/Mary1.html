<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">My MIL told me &quot;Episcopalians don't
believe in the Virgin Mary&quot;...is this true and can you explain? 
 </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>Nonsense! Your MIL is either not Episcopalian, or is suffering ...</P>
<P>from the knee-jerk anti-papist rhetoric of the eighteenth century.
</P>
<P>Of course we believe in the Blessed Virgin. 
</P>
<P>We don't believe that the Blessed Virgin is our co-redemptress
with Christ, or that she has any ability to forgive our sins. Most
Roman Catholics don't believe that, either, although it has some
proponents within the Roman church. 
</P>
<P>The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is a papal declaration,
and as such does not influence Episcopal thought. Although some
Episcopalians do believe that the Blessed Virgin was conceived
without taint of original sin, most don't. It's a matter of personal
conscience. 
</P>
<P>Relatively few Episcopalians ask the Blessed Virgin, or other
saints, to pray for them; preferring to ask the prayers of their
fellow-Christians here on earth to asking the prayers of their
fellow-Christians triumphant in Heaven. But some do, and it is
doctrinally correct to do so. 
</P>
<P>Episcopal churches often have less statuary and fewer icons than
Eastern Orthodox or Roman Catholic churches. Thus, you will less
often see statues and icons of the Blessed Virgin. But you will see
some, and often see beautiful stained glass depictions of the Blessed
Virgin. 
</P>
<P>How does your MIL imagine we think Jesus was born, if we don't
believe in the Virgin Mary? Does she imagine we don't read Scripture,
which teaches us about the Virgin? Does she not realize that we
recite the Apostle's Creed or the Nicene Creed in every service,
including the words &quot;I believe in Jesus Christ, His
only-begotten Son, who was born of ***the Virgin Mary***? 
</P>
<P>Your MIL is wrong.
