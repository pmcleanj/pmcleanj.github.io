<P><FONT SIZE=4><FONT COLOR="#280099">Michaelmas is in just under two
weeks -- are you doing anything?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Last year I made the children mummers' gowns and they put on
impromptu passion plays for us. This year, one of my co-workers is
throwing a barbecue on the 29th. We do gourmet potluck for these
things, so I think I'll take one or two of the medaeival recipes I
found while surfing the web -- the idea from the Steiner site about a
dragon-shaped apple pie sounds pretty impressive! 
</P>
<P>My Liturgy discussion group brought up the custom of &quot;Saint
Michael's Lent&quot; -- a short fast held before the feast of Saint
Michael. One site I found referred to this being on the Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday before Michaelmas; but in Anglican tradition it
seems to me that the Autumn Ember Days would take that role. I think
we will make some effort to keep the Ember days this year -- perhaps
just reading the Collect for table-grace or at evening prayer, and
fore-going dessert this week on Wednesday and Saturday (in addition
to Friday, when we forego dessert anyway). 
</P>

So, anyone want to join me in celebrating a merry feast-day? 
</P>
<P>Some Episcopalians have never heard of Michaelmas. There is a good
reason for this. Different forces in the church have been trying to
stamp out celebrating the seasons since about the seventh century.
First the Roman Catholic missionaries weren't too happy to arrive and
find a thriving church with its own customs -- Rome has never been
big on allowing diversity and freedom of worship throughout the
far-flung church. The value of conformity over the historic practice
of the British church is what the Council of Whitby was all about,
and was subsequently a factor in the Pope's sponsoring William the
Conquerer's invasion of the British Isles. 
</P>
<P>Later, the Puritans tried to eradicate anything that smacked of
either papacy or paganism -- in fact, to eradicate nearly any
observance but the Sabbath, and that they made as dreary as possible
(note -- highly prejudiced Jacobite perspective here!) 
</P>
<P>Now we have right-wing conservative Christians who are trying to
convince us to &quot;keep the Christ in Christmas&quot; but
vociferously deny the &quot;Hallow&quot; in Hallowe'en. 
</P>
<P>I say, bring on the Yule Log, the candles, the coloured eggs, the
bonfires, the cider and the feasting -- and praise God for his many
gifts, the greatest of which is our Lord Jesus Christ: the means of
Grace and the Hope of Glory!
