seven stages of faith development:<BR>Stage 1 -- Primal faith (the
incorporative self): <BR>Stage 2 -- Intuitive projective faith (the
impulsive self): <BR>Stage 3 -- Mythic literal faith (the imperial

journey...</P>
<P>this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Are these stages of
development supposed to be universal, or are they intended to
describe faith development from within a particular cultural context?
I could probably force my experience to fit the model, but it's a bit
of a stretch: 
</P>
<P>I can't of course remember stage one, but I can remember stage 2
-- which was for me a realization that other people believed in
something else. No anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic images of
God; just bemusement. Stage 3 for me was characterized by sensual
images --a parental caress in the feel of the wind on my cheek, or
the sense of being held in strong arms as I dropped off to sleep. But
these amorphous images were uninformed by cultural Deity images. I
don't remember *ever* thinking God could be swayed by bargaining.
Stage 4 -- &quot;Synthetic conventional faith&quot; is also a
toughie, since the prevailing *convention* was *no* faith. 
</P>
<P>I suppose I probably entered in to the developmental model around
stage 5. Certainly, taking the initiative to begin attending church
involved questioning parental authority. At the same time however, I
was fully aware that I was entering *into* particular &quot;socially
defined roles&quot; in doing so; and having to grapple with, and
redefine those roles, to accomodate my unconventional background. But
I didn't have to go through a process of deconstruction within
myself. And, I think, my familiarity with sympathetic magic in
witchcraft actually allowed the understanding of the symbol to
empower it (this is how an icon functions -- in short, I think
Tillich is wrong on this point). 
</P>
<P>Probably Stage 6 characterizes where I am now, with
characteristics of 5 and 7, and even 4 and 3 stirred in to the mix.
I'm a little put off by the words used to describe stage 7 -- this is
far more rhetorical in tone than a scientific analysis usually is. I
think there's some evidence here that the whole model is based on a
particular subjective value system. 
</P>
<P>Two jokes I often tell when I am lecturing on my area of expertise
(which is building models of power systems); or when incorporating a
new engineer into my team: 
</P>
<PRE> The first is an obscure movie reference:
 <A HREF="http://www.montypython.net/sounds/hg/model.wav">http://www.montypython.net/sounds/hg/model.wav</A> 
 (Camelot! Camelot!! Camelot!!! It's only a model. Shhhh!!)
 The second: &quot;An engineer and a mathematician are sitting on the 
 beach when a gorgeous blond runs by. The engineer leaps up and
 begins pursuing. After a moment, the bemused mathematician also
 gets up. Panting along behind the engineer, the mathematician 
 says 'What are you doing? You know, you can never catch up. 
 Before you do, you will get halfway, and still have half the 
 distance to go. And before you can cover that distance, you 
 will half to go halfway. You will *always* have halfway left 
 to go!&quot; The engineer shrugs, &quot;I can get close enough for all
 *practical* purposes&quot;.</PRE><P>
This *is* only a model. What is the purpose of this model? My use for
a model is usually to see things about myself (or others, usually my
children -- or about the electric grid &lt;g&gt;) that I do not
perceive directly. This model doesn't do that for me. I find myself
seeing it as a standard to measure my &quot;enlightenment quotient&quot;,
and I'm not really comfortable with that.
