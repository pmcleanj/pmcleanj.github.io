<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">What are the Church's responsibilities
in the Sacraments?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">{In this post the word &quot;Church&quot;
means &quot;The mystical Body of Christ, which is the blessed company
of all faithful people&quot; -- that is to say, you, me, and the guy
at the end of the pew who looks funny (and also the Church
Triumphant, i.e. the risen saints, but in this post I'm targetting
the Church Militant).} 
</P>
<P>When my darling daughters were baptized, the congregation stood up
in church, listened to the priest's question &quot;will you who
witness these vows do all that is in your power to support these
people in their new life in Christ?&quot;, and answered aloud, &quot;We
will!&quot; 
</P>
<P>The next week, and for the next 250 weeks, give or take, one or
another of the ACW ladies would discretely suggest to me that
actually bringing my baby/toddler(s) into Church was inappropriate
behaviour and that everyone would be better off if I conformed to the
norms and left my children with the child-minder in the church
basement like all the other young mothers. Having a strong
paedagogical foundation myself, I ignored this bad advice and kept on
bringing my children where they could hear the Liturgy, see and touch
the iconography, smell the incense, and taste and see that the Lord
is good. The good ladies responded with harassment that ended in us
worshipping elsewhere for the sake of the children. 
</P>
<P>The ironic part is that most of those ladies were there, and
opened their mouths, and apparently voiced that ringing &quot;We
Will&quot; along with every other member of the congregation. 
</P>
<P>We have seven sacraments. Although many of them seem personal or
individual -- unction, reconciliation, and marriage in particular --
all the sacraments are given to the Church and intended for building
up of the Church. 
</P>
<P>I recently heard a suggestion on the role that a divorce liturgy
could play for the Church: that a divorce liturgy is needed as a way
for the community of faith to acknowledge its own responsibility for
a marriage that failed; that though the church is 100% responsible,
it shares responsibility. The refusal of churches to acknowledge this
is a major contributing factor to the high divorce rate among
Christians. 
</P>
<P>We similarly have the occasional rite for reaffirmation of
baptismal vows by adults who are returning to the church after having
&quot;fallen away&quot;. In most Anglican jurisdictions, very little
emphasis if any is placed on the &quot;penitence&quot; of the
returning believer. But in those jurisdictions that do frame this
rite as &quot;Reception of a Penitent&quot;, commentors have
similarly remarked on the need for the Church to express its
penitence over the alienation or lack of nurture that caused the
&quot;lost sheep&quot; to get lost in the first place. Whatever it
was, was it not a violation of that mutual responsibility we have in
Baptism, to do all that is in our power to support one another in our
new life in Christ? 
</P>
<P>That both Matrimony and Baptism offer us examples of the Church's
failing to fulfil our sacramental calling, begs the question of how
we may be failing in our responsibility regarding the other
sacraments. Certainly we can all think of examples where we have
failed to support the Sacrament of Ordination, by undermining our own
Priests and Bishops. 
</P>
<P>But the more important question is not, how have we failed to live
up to our responsibilities; but rather, what are we called to do in
order to fulfill our responsibilities to one another in the
Sacraments?</P>
