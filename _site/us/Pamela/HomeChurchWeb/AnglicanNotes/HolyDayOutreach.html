Christian Liturgical Year: an opportunity for outreach</B></FONT></P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Summary</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Christmas and Easter have become so overloaded
with frenetic intensity that, especially for unchurched families,
they can become unrewarding days of stress and conflict that leave
folk still hungering for some sense of meaning. Their hunger is an
opportunity for Christian to reclaim traditional holidays from
Christian history that we can share to help meet their need for
spiritual meaning, with Christ as the focal point of every tradition
we restore. For the sake of those we serve, we must exhume our
traditions out of history, and offer them to our world!</P>
<P CLASS="western">The most significant historical holidays in
addition to Easter and Christmas are Candlemas (February 2), Ladymas
(March 25), Roodmas (May 3), Pentecost, StJeanmas (June 24), Lammas
(August 1), Michaelmas (September 29), Hallowmas (November 1). In
mediaeval times, these holidays enjoyed all the characteristics that
make the difference between an unobserved &ldquo;Holy Day&rdquo; and
a beloved holiday: public worship; story-telling; familiarity,
tradition and nostalgia; shared community activities and a shared
understanding of symbols; gift-giving, and special foods. Nowadays,
these holidays&rsquo; traditions are no longer observed and are
largely forgotten. But we can select, prayerfully, what traditions to
reintroduce and how to reintroduce them in a way that reaches out to
meet our neighbourhood&rsquo;s spiritual needs.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Different traditional customs are documented for
each of these, and most of those traditions can be re-cast in a
modern setting, particularly as outreach events. We do need to
recognize that offering such events will demand considerable
commitment on the part of Emmanuel&rsquo;s people. We may well need
to persist through two or three years of sparse attendance, to give
the events time to catch on. But we can also expect considerable
rewards, as these Holy Days&rsquo; traditions are inherently fun and
meaningful. And we can expect to see Emmanuel grow as a church only
if we are sincere in our commitment to outreach.</P>
<P CLASS="western">To avoid taking on too much to soon, a modest
proposal is presented, of adding two Holy-day celebrations to our
calendar in 2007. The first of these, a Roodmas/Rogation celebration
featuring a gardening lecture, plant-exchange and Maypole dance, is
driven by the urgency of reaching out to new families moving in to
the condominiums down the road. The second of these, a
Lammas/Michaelmas celebration in late August, is driven by the need
to reconnect with our Vacation Bible School families as they are
returning from vacation and making their plans for the new school
year. In subsequent years we would need to persist in offering these
two events to allow attendance to build up, and might consider adding
additional events to our schedule.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A number of questions remain. Will these events
actually appeal to the people of our neighbourhood? If we don&rsquo;t
make the effort to offer such events, we will never know. Do these
events speak deeply enough of Emmanuel&rsquo;s Christian heritage,
that we can succeed in making them meaningful for unchurched people?
And most of all, are we truly willing to put significant effort into
reaching out to draw others to Jesus?</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">Holidays and Seasons</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Christmas and Easter: that&rsquo;s the whole tally
of Christian holidays, for most of us &ndash; two days a year to
celebrate the whole story of creation and salvation that we try to
live out for 365 days of the year. For our ancestors, much wiser than
we, those two days were only the brightest and best of a whole annual
pattern of celebration and remembrance. For us, those two days have
to support all the frenetic intensity of family obligation and
consumerism that our ancestors spread over a dozen or more high
holy-days. And so, especially for unchurched families, Easter and
Christmas become unrewarding days of stress and conflict that leave
folk emotionally depleted and still hungering for some sense of
meaning. Easter and Christmas need to be redeemed, by restoring them
to their proper place within a larger set of holy-days and
celebrations.</P>
<P CLASS="western">God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse
of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as
signs to mark seasons and days and years&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>.
One or the other of God&rsquo;s two great lights: the Sun or the
Moon, typically defines a calendar: our western &ldquo;Gregorian&rdquo;
calendar is based on the Sun&rsquo;s cycle, for example, while the
middle-eastern calendar of Islamic countries is based on the Moon&rsquo;s
cycle. Both the solar and the lunar cycle combine to determine the
holy days of the Christian Year, as is well illustrated by the two
holy-days whose popular celebration still survives, Christmas and
Easter.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Sun&rsquo;s cycle is defined by the axial tilt
of the Earth. As Earth circles the Sun, its axial tilt results in
summer with its longer days, and then winter with its shorter days.
The longest day and the shortest day are obviously special, as are
the two equinoxes half-way between. Our celebration of the shortest
day of the year survives as Christmas<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>.
The ancient church also had St Johnmas on the shortest night (June
24), and Ladymas (March 25) and Michaelmas (September 29) on the two
equinoxes. In between each of these seasonal holy-days, the ancient
church celebrated &ldquo;cross-over&rdquo; days: Candlemas (February
2), Roodmas (May 3), Lammas (August 1) and Hallowmas (November 1).</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Moon&rsquo;s cycle is defined by the waxing
and waning of the moon as it goes from new moon to first quarter to
full moon to third quarter to the dark of the moon. The phase of the
moon determines the timing of Easter according to the following rule:
Easter is the first Sunday after the first new moon after the spring
equinox<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>.
Easter in turn determines the timing of Pentecost, which is fifty
days after Easter<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>,
and Ash Wednesday, which is forty days before Easter<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In addition to these ancient holy-days written, as
it were, by God Himself in the great lights of Creation, numerous
&ldquo;Saints&rsquo; Days&rdquo; were celebrated by the medaeival.
Some of these Saints&rsquo; Days honoured the Apostles and other
biblical saints whose witness points persistently to Christ, but many
overemphasised spurious saints and distracted from Christ. As we seek
to reclaim for God the holiness of passing time, Christ must be the
focal point of every tradition we restore.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Our ancient Holy tradition of faith, then, gives
us a wealth of nine seasonal holidays over the commercialised and
secularised two. Such wealth can only have one proper use &ndash; to
use it and expend it on God&rsquo;s work in the world. God&rsquo;s
work sends us out to serve our city&rsquo;s an unchurched families
and young adults, who often dabble in alternative traditions and new
religions for the allure of their imported or made-up symbols and
rituals. Those rituals are empty of grace, and can never satisfy such
seekers; but in contrast the Church&rsquo;s rich historical
traditions celebrate the ultimate grace of our salvation. But can
seekers find those traditions in our church? Or, only in our history?
For the sake of those we serve, we must exhume our traditions out of
history, and offer them to our world! 
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">From &ldquo;Holy Day&rdquo; to &ldquo;Holiday&rdquo;?</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Easter and Christmas are unquestionably holidays.
But on our Church Calendars they are recorded as &ldquo;Holy Days&rdquo;
&ndash; as are Candlemas and Michaelmas and many other holy days that
most people, especially unchurched people, have never heard of. What
have Christmas and Easter got going for them, that those other holy
days don&rsquo;t have? 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Maybe, the characteristics that make Easter and
Christmas special can be named, and then made more general. Human
nature being universal, they will be the same characteristics that
make other holidays like Passover or Chinese New Year successful &ndash;
and they will be lacking in holidays like &ldquo;Heritage Day&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Labour Day&rdquo; that manifest as a day off work and
nothing more. Once identified, those same characteristics could be
&ldquo;custom-tailored&rdquo; for each of the holy days that we want
to reclaim. So, what are the characteristics of a holiday?</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Spiritual Dimension: Public Worship</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Unique and focused worship services are always a
part of Easter and Christmas. In theory, pecial services focusing on
their commemorations &ndash; usually several. In theory, special
services exist for many of the other Holy Days on our Calendar, but
they are often ignored or have fallen into disuse, even in more
centralized churches that have church rules supposedly requiring that
such services be held. Easter and Christmas services are easily
scheduled with the expectation that the statutory holiday will leave
the people free to attend worship. Services for other holidays will
have to be scheduled in the evening or transferred to an adjacent
weekend, in order to offer people the opportunity to attend.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In the case of events meant to reach out to the
community, Mary Green has strongly recommended holding the events
outside the church building proper. She has noticed that outdoor
event attract far more people than do indoor events. Our unchurched
neighbours are often unfamiliar with churches in general and
uncomfortable going into such an unfamiliar place. And, of course,
passers-by cannot tell what kind of event is going on if all they see
is cars in the parking lot. If as they drive or walk by they see
crowds celebrating, they are more likely to join in to the current
event, or perhaps the next event.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If we accept Mary&rsquo;s recommendation, then
worship associated with these events should be truly public &ndash;
held out of doors along with the event. It should be short, up-beat,
and highly targeted on the Christian tradition being celebrated. It
should avoid &ldquo;churchy&rdquo; buzzwords, but we should not be
hesitant about showing off our symbols or spirituality: these, after
all, are what our neighbours hunger for. But any symbols we use in
such outreach worship should be explained. Being &ldquo;in the know&rdquo;
about symbols and traditions creates a sense of belonging, which may
in time encourage these neighbours to cross the threshold of the
church building itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A brief out-door worship service can create a
focus for whatever event we hold. In the wall-less venue of our
parking lot, such a focus is necessary to keep people from drifting
back out onto the sidewalk and pathways and drifting away. A certain
concentration of social energy must be maintained to keep any event
going. So a Master of Ceremonies of some kind &ndash; with a public
address system -- is needed. The MC&rsquo;s job is to gather together
all the visitors to the event, let them know what is going on and
what&rsquo;s expected, and create a sense of hospitality. The public
worship should fit into the event plan as an understate-but-formal
way of managing the focus of the event. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Story-Telling</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Easter and Christmas are
all about telling stories. The Christmas pageant and the Maundy
foot-washing service and the Christmas pageant tell through drama how
Christ was born and how He gave us his &ldquo;new commandment&rdquo;.
The service of Carols and Lessons tells through reading scripture the
story of how Christ&rsquo;s birth was fortold. The Good Friday
reading tells us the whole story of Christ&rsquo;s betrayal and
condemnation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">At home, we read stories like &ldquo;A Christmas
Carol&rdquo; and watch TV specials that reiterate in a worldly
context the stories of the holidays we are participating in. Through
stories, we teach one another what these holidays celebrate. Over and
over we find ways of communicating &ldquo;the true meaning&rdquo; of
Christmas and Easter.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If people are to learn the true meaning of other
Holy Days, then we must teach those stories. And we must use the most
powerful methods of teaching, since the stories are so unfamiliar.
Reading aloud from Scripture won&rsquo;t work in outreach work, in
part because we often fail to make the story come alive because of
our own awareness that what we are reading is Scripture, in part
because Scripture often sounds dated and artificial to unchurched
people, and in part because the physical act of reading prevents
eye-contact and creates a distance between reader and audience.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Powerful teaching takes the form of drama, of oral
story-telling with repetition and with figures of speech tying in to
the hearer&rsquo;s own experience, and of participative activities
that illustrate the story. For every event that we put on, one or
more forms of powerful storytelling should have a role in the event.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Historic Dimension: Tradition and Nostalgia</H3>
<P CLASS="western">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done this twice now, so it&rsquo;s
a tradition!&rdquo; People love to know what is about to happen. They
love to feel in touch with their heritage and to be part of something
bigger than themselves. They will find themselves drawn more to a
&ldquo;second annual&rdquo; &ndash; or even a &ldquo;first annual&rdquo;
&ndash; event than to the same event that doesn&rsquo;t include those
words. An activity framed with an explanation of its traditional
roots has more appeal than the same activity divorced from a
traditional explanation. But most of all, an activity that can be
remembered from previous years without a gap has more appeal than a
novel or sporadic activity. This is why, in many congregations, a
special event that is sparsely attended in the first year or two
becomes an expected regular event if only the organizers have the
persistence to keep it up in the face of limited early participation.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Community Dimension: Shared Symbols and
Activities</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The symbols of Easter and Christmas are all around
us in society. Even corrupted by materialism, those symbols reinforce
our holiday spirit. When our families gather from far-flung
destinations to share the celebration with us, that further
reinforces our holiday spirit. Nothing touches us so poignantly, as
the thought of someone celebrating Christmas alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Paul wrote to the Corinthians that they should
&ldquo;remember to practice hospitality.&rdquo; Even though we cannot
expect our relatives to travel home a dozen times a year to celebrate
holidays with us, we can invite community members to share activities
and meals with us.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Gift-giving</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">In modern culture,
gift-giving is almost synonymous with Christmas. But Easter has its
Easter baskets too, Hallowe&rsquo;en has its relatively trivial gifts
to the neighbourhood trick-or-treators, and even Valentine&rsquo;s
day has its little cards.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Carnal dimension: Special Food!</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Saint Paul tells us that everything God has given
is good, but not necessarily good for us. This duality is often
incorporated in successful holidays, by being preceded by a fast or
time of abstinence: Easter by Lent, Christmas by Advent, Passover by
Rosh Hashanah; Eid by Ramadan. The other half of the duality, of
course, are the wonderful distinctive foods that are associated with
each holiday: the Easter Ham, the Thanksgiving Turkey, the Christmas
Pudding -- foods that are made more special by being reserved for
their proper holiday.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">The Christian Year</H1>
<P CLASS="western">The most significant historical Holy Days in the
Christian year --  in addition to Easter and Christmas -- are
Candlemas (February 2), Ladymas (March 25), Roodmas (May 3),
Pentecost, StJeanmas (June 24), Lammas (August 1), Michaelmas
(September 29), Hallowmas (November 1). Some of these days are
already celebrated within the family of our church, and may be better
opportunities for strengthening new Christians than for reaching out
to others &ndash; remembering that new Christians, as much as
seekers, may yearn for rich symbolic ways to express their new faith.
Other days, especially those timed around some shared human
experience, may be better for reaching out to the community. We can
select, prayerfully, what traditions to reintroduce and how to
reintroduce them in a way that best meets the neighbourhood&rsquo;s
spiritual needs. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Christmas (December 25)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; is &ldquo;The
Nativity of Our Lord&rdquo;. We do a good job already of attracting
the &ldquo;Christmas and Easter&rdquo; Christians to church to one of
the Christmas Eve services, and the four weeks of Advent with their
focus on the Advent Wreath help provide balance to the season. We
could do more, by remembering that Christmas itself is twelve days
long, and lasts past the first (and sometimes second) Sunday after
December 25. These are the days &ndash; not the Sundays in Advent &ndash;
when we appropriately sing Christmas carols and luxuriate in the
nostalgia of Christmas past. Why not hold the lovely service of
Carols and Lessons routinely on the first or second Sunday in
Christmas, and invite our neighbours to share that well-known service
while they are still in a nostalgic and church-friendly mood? Or,
perhaps, go caroling in the neighbourhood and take the carols and
lessons out into the community?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Candlemas (February 2 &ndash; a Saturday in 2008</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of &ldquo;Candlemas&rdquo; is &ldquo;The
Presentation of Christ in the Temple&rdquo;. Like Christmas, it is a
scriptural feast-day and a &ldquo;feast of Light&rdquo;. It
celebrates the day, forty days after the birth of their first son,
that Mary and Joseph came to the temple to sacrifice two small birds.
This was the occasion on which Anna and Simeon prophesied over the
Christ-child, and Simeon proclaimed in his famous song that Jesus
would be &ldquo;A light to lighten the Gentiles, And the glory of thy
people Israel.&rdquo; On this day, the ancient church blessed the
candles that would be used in worship for the coming year. The people
would bring their own candle and light it from the church-candles, to
carry &ldquo;the light of Christ&rdquo; home to their own homes.</P>
<P CLASS="western">On February 2, I cook a &ldquo;feast&rdquo; of two
small birds with rice, in a crock-pot or slow oven and invite friends
or neighbours to join us for dinner. All the candles in the house are
placed on the dining-room table, and all the lights t are turned off.
Then after school and work we take candle lanterns, one for each
family-member and dinner-guest and go &ndash; preferably to church,
but since our church to doesn&rsquo;t hold Candlemas services &ndash;
to the home of one of our dinner-guests. There, we read the story of
the Presentation, pray, and light our candles. From there we process
home together, singing hymns about Light and Fire, such as &ldquo;this
little light of mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Revival Fire Fall&rdquo;. When
we get home, we take turns lighting the candles on the dining-table.
As each candle is lit, we recite the names of a family or other
community group that we are praying for. And when all the candles are
lit, we turn on lights, blow out candles, clear and reset the table,
and start the feast. Then, of course, we all watch Groundhog Day on
DVD.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">A Candlelight Procession</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The church is a far more appropriate venue for a
brief February 2 Service of the Word with candle-lighting. If kept
very brief or if the weather is very warm, the service could be held
on the Church porch. It might be a good idea to use the service also
to rehearse one or two appropriate hymns, since many people may not
have such hymns memorized and &ldquo;on tap&rdquo;. But just imagine
the visual impact on the community, of a little crowd of singing
Christians fanning out from the churchyard carrying their
candle-lanterns!</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Ladymas (March 25 &ndash; a Tuesday in 2008)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of Ladymas is &ldquo;The
Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary&rdquo; &ndash; but don&rsquo;t
mistake it as a festival focusing on Mary. What was being announced
was the coming of Christ, so this is a festival focused on the Lord
himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western">But it&rsquo;s also in the middle of Lent, at the
very end of Winter, at a time when all fresh food is long-since stale
or eaten; and the delights of fresh breezes and the occasional
birdsong must take the place of riotous feasting. In ancient times
craftspeople who had spent the winter at their handwork grasped this
first opportunity to travel to find a fair and sell their product,
and housewives threw wide the shutters to let out the smell and grime
of six months&rsquo; peatsmoke; leaving Ladymas associated primarily
with market-fairs and spring cleaning.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In our family I&rsquo;ve set aside &ldquo;Lady
Tarts&rdquo; -- a special small pastry made of raspberry jam, almond
custard, and sweet meringue &ndash; as Ladymas&rsquo; special food.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In 2008 we see the very unusual situation, where
Ladymas falls in Easter week, something that could never have
happened prior to the Gregorian calendar reform. When Ladymas falls
in either Holy Week or Easter Week, it is traditionally not observed.
So, this may be a neighbourhood celebration that we can &ldquo;phase
in&rdquo; in a subsequent year.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Lady-Day Faire</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Why not combine the ideas of market-fairs and
spring cleaning to hold a neighbourhood garage sale in the parking
lot. Invite neighbours to come and set up a card-table, sell their
wares and pocket their profits. Church groups could sell bazaar
crafts or food. Other church-groups could set up ministry-fair style
booths to advertise Sunday School, the coming Vacation Bible School
(working mothers do start planning summer out-of-school care as early
as march) and so on. Build on the motif of a Lady-Day Faire by having
the worship team as modern minstrels, and story-tellers to tell the
story of, among other things, just what Lady Day is.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Easter</H2>
<P CLASS="western">We already have a wonderful celebration of Easter,
with our sunrise worship, parish breakfast, and Easter worship. And
Easter like Christmas is a day when the church is so full of
&ldquo;Easter-and-Christmas&rdquo; Christians that we wouldn&rsquo;t
have room for our unchurched neighbours, even if we could persuade
them to come in. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">However, the traditional Church celebrated Easter
nearly continuously from Palm Sunday until Easter. On Wednesday in
Holy Week the traditional service of &ldquo;Tenebrae&rdquo; is held,
dramatically illustrating the growing spiritual darkness as we draw
near to Good Friday. On Thursday, a four-part service may be held,
starting with the commemoration of Christ&rsquo;s &ldquo;New
Commandment&rdquo; which He illustrated by washing the disciples&rsquo;
feet, then a shared Agape meal recapitulating a Seder meal, then the
celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper that Christ instituted on this
day, and finally the stripping of the Altar. On Good Friday is the
Way of the Cross and often additional solemn worship. Then on
Saturday night is held the a candlelight service called the &ldquo;Great
Vigil of Easter&rdquo;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Saturday-night candlelight service, and our
sunrise service on Easter Morning, are actually two ends of the same
tradition. In the ancient church, believers would gather on Saturday
night to wait together for the promise of Easter. There they would
kindle a new fire, light candles from it, and in the quiet
candlelight as they kept vigil, they would recount the great stories
of God&rsquo;s saving grace throughout history: of God&rsquo;s
preserving Noah through the flood, of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham,
of the Exodus, of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophetic witness to Christ. As the
adult believers prayed, retold scriptures, and kept watch; the
church&rsquo;s children dozed or heard the stories that would shape
their faith. Finally, as sunrise marked the horizon, new believers
would be baptized and the whole congregation would celebrate their
Easter communion together.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Maundy Thursday Agape Meal</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Emmanuel currently has a
Maundy Thursday service, and long-term parishioners recount that we
have held an Agape meal in the past. We should consider restoring the
custom. Although it is unlikely that unchurched people from the
neighbourhood would come for the meal, we could expect it to appeal
to new members attracted by other outreach events, and to old members
who can always afford to be strengthened by fellowship and by
participating in our shared story. A &ldquo;Christian Seder&rdquo; is
probably not the best choice for such a meal, as it involves
considerable work and can be offensive to our Jewish neighbours. A
simple candlelight meal of bread and wine, milk and honey, apples and
raw-vegetable &ldquo;herbs&rdquo; captures the most essential symbols
of the Passover story with minimal effort.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Good Friday Fasting and Hot-cross Buns</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Fasting is not much taught
as a spiritual discipline, at Emmanuel. It is certainly not an
appropriate vehicle for outreach! But, as with the Thursday Agape
meal, it can be an excellent step in the Christian formation of new
and old members. An old tradition is to fast until the end of the
Good Friday service, which traditionally lasted a long time, from
noon until three in the afternoon. Then at the end of the service,
the children at least (and why not the adults, too?) would break
their fast on freshly baked hot spicy buns marked with, a reminder of
the spices that Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus took to Jesus&rsquo;
tomb. Of course, it is much less of a fast if it only lasts until the
end of a short morning service. But even so, Emmanuel&rsquo;s members
might well benefit from sound teaching on the value of fasting, some
encouragement to fast for even those few hours on Good Friday
morning, and a tray of hot buns fresh from Emmanuel&rsquo;s oven at
the end of the Good Friday service.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Easter Eve Campfire and Bedtime-stories</H3>
<P CLASS="western">In every culture, stories told around the fire are
part of how we transcend our own generation and pass our culture to
our children. Could we use this holy night, and the magical allure of
the new fire, to pass on our faith to our spiritually hungry
neighbours? Could we offer their children an evening of stories
around the fire, timed to precede bedtime and accompanied by a cup of
hot chocolate?</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Roodmas (May 3) and Rogation Day</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name for roodmas is &ldquo;The
Exaltation of the Holy Cross&rdquo;, and it is said to commemorate
the date in 326 when workers found a wooden beam claimed to be the
True Cross<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP>.
But it is more likely that Roodmas was already being celebrated in
Northern Europe as a spring sowing festivals, featuring the Maypole.
The Maypole is &ldquo;the tree of life&rdquo; &ndash; which is, after
all, exactly what the cross is. A small cross-bar at the top of a
Christian Maypole anchors the ribbons to the pole &ndash; and reminds
us all that the Resurrection has transformed an instrument of brutal
death into a beautiful symbol of blessing, life and plenty.</P>
<P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Rogation&rdquo; means &ldquo;solemn
prayer&rdquo;. Rogation Day is the fifth Sunday after Easter, and in
pre-industrial times it was traditionally a day of prayer for the
harvest, whose seeds should have just been sown. But in Alberta, with
our short growing season and late frosts, sowing the harvest cannot
move back and forth with the phases of the moon, so the traditional
timing of Rogation Day is as meaningless as is, to most people&rsquo;s
vocabulary, the word &ldquo;Rogation&rdquo; itself. For that matter,
in our highly urban society, most people have forgotten that the
harvest needs to be sown and that we eat, come the fall, only at the
mercy of our Father.</P>
<P CLASS="western">BUT &ndash; especially in our highly urban
society, people are healthier when they are in touch with the earth.
A disproportionately high number of urbanites are gardeners, if often
ineffectual ones. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">The Blessing of the Gardens</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Canadians have a well-defined day for our
gardening, with Victoria Day as a statutory holiday on which to
celebrate it<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>.
Right now, our church is seeing new condominiums springing up in the
formerly vacant land around us, and new families moving in seeking to
set down roots &ndash; both literally and figuratively, by starting
their first-ever gardens. Many of them may not count established
gardeners among their friends, from whom they can expect divisions of
established perennials or good advice about what will or won&rsquo;t
grow in Calgary. So why not sponsor a speaker from the Zoo or the
horticultural society, to give a short outdoor lecture on &ldquo;windowbox
and small-plot gardening&rdquo;. Established gardeners could come and
trade perennials or cuttings and recycle some old plant-pots; and
extras could be given away to new gardeners just starting out. We
could ask the pastor to open or close the party with a short service
of the Word, and ask God&rsquo;s blessing on our city&rsquo;s gardens
and our province&rsquo;s farmlands.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Pentecost</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Pentecost commemorates commemorating the day when
the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believers. Pentecost means
&ldquo;fifty days&rdquo;, and occurred as a harvest festival in the
Old Testament, fifty days after Passover. For us, its commemoration
occurs fifty days after Easter, though unlike the Mediterreanian with
its three harvests a year, northern Europe and Canada never see a
harvest so early.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Because this is the &ldquo;birthday of the
Church&rdquo;, its an appropriate day for nurturing our members
rather than for outreach. On Pentecost day many congregations
encourage members to wear red &ndash; for the Fire of the Holy Spirit
&ndash; and serve birthday cake during coffee. Because the Gift of
the Holy Spirit was poured out on the first Pentecost, it&rsquo;s a
traditional day for Baptisms and Confirmations, where the Holy Spirit
is poured out on new or maturing Christians. From this &ndash; and
from the tradition of catechumens&rsquo; and confirmands&rsquo;
wearing white &ndash; Pentecost is also called &ldquo;Whitsunday&rdquo;.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">StJohnmas (June 24)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of StJohnmas (pronounced
&ldquo;SINjinmas&rdquo;) is &ldquo;The Nativity of Saint John the
Baptist&rdquo;. In Canada, particularly Quebec, it has been
celebrated as a national festival; but traditionally it was
celebrated as a counterpoint to Christmas, like the modern &ldquo;Christmas
in July&rdquo; celebrations that have sprung up in recent years.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In counterpoint to Christmas when the family
gathers indoors around their Christmas Tree, at StJeanmas the family
gathers outdoors around a bonfire. An important feature is to be able
to offer refreshment and hospitality to passers-by. Our family bakes
bannock on sticks over an open fire &ndash; wrapped in bacon for an
extra treat!.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Lammas (August 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of Lammas is &ldquo;The Feast of
First Fruits&rdquo;. This is the first of three harvest-thanksgiving
feasts from Northern Europe. Of the eight traditional solar-cycle
feasts, it is the only one that makes no effort to commemorate any
event from Our Lord&rsquo;s life: it is a pure harvest thanksgiving,
timed to the very beginning of harvest, as berries and small fruits
begin to become available. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Our Saskatoon bushes and non-king cherries
dutifully come ripe on this day; and we celebrate with a &ldquo;lammas
pudding&rdquo; for dessert, made of bread stuffed with fresh berries
molded and chilled, and then served with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Gardens are generally at their best and in full
bloom by this time, so a garden-party is an appropriate Lammas-day
celebration. It could be combined with &ldquo;Heritage Day&rdquo; and
take advantage of the Heritage Day statutory holiday. Why not
celebrate our overtly Christian heritage? We could go further, and
showcase the Danish, German, Norwegian and Swedish traditions that
enrich our Lutheran form of Christianity. By advertising a &ldquo;Heritage
Day Garden Party&rdquo; to our secular neighbours, we would be taking
advantage of the shared experience of Heritage Day simultaneously
being advertised for other city events.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">An End-of-Summer Garden Party</H3>
<P CLASS="western">But in Calgary, many families are away on vacation
and August is our &ldquo;lazy time&rdquo;, when few people are
interested in making the effort to attend organized events, and Mary
Green has suggested that what we really need is an event just as
school is starting back up, to reconnect with our Vacation Bible
School families as they return from summer vacation. So, another
option would be to combine Lammas with Michaelmas and have a
garden-party half-way between the two, drawing in traditions from
both historic holy days.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Michaelmas (September 29)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The proper name of Michaelmas is &ldquo;The Feast
of Saint Michael and All Angels&rdquo;. This is the second harvest
festival, marking the end of the grain harvest and the start of the
large fruits and winter-vegetable harvest. What it commemorates,
however, is the victory in heaven of Michael and all Angels over the
great beast that was cast out of heaven. In mediaeval church art, the
Archangel Michael is often shown with a wounded dragon at his feet. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Michaelmas (pronounced &ldquo;mikklemas&rdquo;),
falling at the autumn equinox, is counterpoint to Ladymas. It&rsquo;s
the traditional start to the school term in England, and in mediaeval
times also often featured a fall Harvest faire; and mummery or
guising. Guising involved dressing up as saints and biblical
characters to travel from house to house putting on miniature passion
plays, and was a sophisticated form of begging.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Our family&rsquo;s Michaelmas tradition features a
large dragon-shaped apple pie. We support our angelic heavely allies
in their war upon the dragon by biting it with our teeth and
digesting it in our bellies, in support of our allies in heaven. We
have a box of special dress-up clothes that come out only for
Michaelmas, and the children are encouraged to produce an impromptu
play dramatizing the story of the War in the Heavenlies or some other
scriptural theme.</P>
<P CLASS="western">One congregation I know put on a &ldquo;Mediaeval
Banquet&rdquo; for several years. This was a full-dinner ticketed
event with food and entertainment styled on the twelfth century and
full of good fun. The props from the event are still around and have
been shared since by other churches putting on their own version of
the events. Although it takes considerable effort, a Mediaeval
Banquet would be an excellent way for a congregation to showcase
Michaelmas while having a great deal of fun.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Hallowmas (November 1)</H2>
<P CLASS="western">&ldquo;Hallow&rdquo; means &ldquo;Holy&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;Saint&rdquo;; and Hallowmas is better known to us &ldquo;All
Saints Day&rdquo;. Its Eve is better-known still, as Hallowe'en. The
Hallowe'en theme of ghosties and dead spirits recognizes, however
coarsely, that all the departed saints continue to be with us within
the communion of saints. In North America, we have borrowed the
custom of guising -- including the door-to-door begging that
accompanied mediaeval guising &ndash; from Michaelmas. Guising isn&rsquo;t
originally a Hallowmas custom, and we&rsquo;ve certainly lost the
scriptural focus of mediaeval guising! Alas, we have also lost any
sense of commemorating the Saints and instead allowed a vulgar focus
on gore and the macabre to take over the day. The secularization of
Hallowe&rsquo;en is an urgent warning of what might happen to that
other most beloved holiday were we to fail at keeping the &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;
in &ldquo;Christmas&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s put the &ldquo;Hallow&rdquo;
back in &ldquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en&rdquo;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Anything that commemorates the faithful departed
-- whether ancient Saints whom you revere, or recent saints who are
dear at a more personal level, is a good celebration of All Saints.
We can bake and share family recipes that were specialties of
now-dead relatives. We can take some flowers or flowerseeds to tend
some of the abandoned graves in the old graveyard by the Stampede
grounds. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">A Children&rsquo;s Hallowe&rsquo;en/Harvest Party</H3>
<P CLASS="western">At the same time, a growing trend in the inner
cities is for children to attend safe Hallowe&rsquo;en or parties (in
fundamentalist churches often called &ldquo;fall harvest&rdquo;
parties in opposition to the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; roots they
misperceive in Halloween). Trick-or-treating is a dwindling custom in
many neighbourhoods. If children are going to abandon
trick-or-treating in favour of indoor parties anyway, Emmanuel may be
well advised to invite our neighbourhood children to a party here.
Certainly Hallowe&rsquo;en is another holiday where we can take
advantage of our culture&rsquo;s existing strong shared symbols,
while restoring the Christian understanding of &quot;All Saints&rdquo;.
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Proposal</H1>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">Our church is well located
to attract neighbourhood families to special events several times a
year. Such events could draw on Christian tradition to centre around
the life of Our Lord, while speaking into the every-day experience of
secular and unchurched Calgarians. Many of these traditions being
unfamiliar to Emmanuel, we should move slowly and patiently, adding
only one or two such events to our repertoire each year, until we are
fully celebrating the Church Year and sharing those celebrations with
our neighbours. A full cycle of Holy-Day celebrations might comprise:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a Candlemas
	Procession,</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a Lady-Day Faire,

	Christmas-in-June party, 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a combined
	Lammas/Michaelmas festival, perhaps if the &ldquo;Lady-Day Faire&rdquo;
	is successful, done as a Michaelmas faire</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">a
	Hallowmas/Reformation festival, and</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">additional balancing
	outreach at Christmas (Carols and Lessons in the community)</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0in">additional balancing
	outreach at Easter (Easter Eve stories and campfire)</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western">These special Holy-day celebrations, which would
be new to Emmanuel, cannot be launched all at once. They should be
added a couple each year, and then maintained from year to year to
create a sense of expectation, both in the neighbourhood and in the
Emmanuel community. Some immediate needs may drive which events we
choose to resource first: the new condominiums North of the church
are filling with new families that have never before gardened, and
our Vacation Bible School this summer is expected to bring us new
families that we will want to try to re-engage with some event prior
to the start of school in the fall.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A number of questions remain. Will these Holy Days
actually appeal to the people of our neighbourhood? If we don&rsquo;t
make the effort to offer such events, we will never know. Do these
events speak deeply enough of Emmanuel&rsquo;s Christian heritage,
that we can succeed in making them meaningful for unchurched people?
And most of all, are we truly willing to put significant effort into
reaching out to draw others to Jesus?</P>
