<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Syncretism is &quot;the attempt or
tendency to combine or reconcile differing beliefs&quot;. It is a
particularly relevant issue as western society becomes more
pluralistic and less homogenous, so that we find ourselves more
frequently encountering differing beliefs. Yet to some extent,
Christians have been facing syncretism for millenia. 
</P>
<P>Conservative Christians often condemn syncretism for allowing
pagan elements to taint pure Christianity. Especially it arises in
accusatory form when Christians worship using non-conformant images
or appellations for God, as in this article titled &quot;The Sin of
Syncretism&quot;: <A HREF="http://www.pbc.org/dp/goins/4390.html" TARGET="_blank">http://www.pbc.org/dp/goins/4390.html</A></P>
<P>Other Christians see that good can come from syncretism provided
that the truth of the gospel is preserved. As a Celtic Christian --
indeed a <I>Mac Ghille Eothain</I> -- and with Celtic Christianity
being the rootstock of the original pre-Roman Anglican church, I
happen to think the syncretism that allowed Christianity to thrive in
Celtic spirituality without the destructive loss of our culture, was
a very good thing. Apparently in apologetical circles the term
&quot;contextualization&quot; is now being used for 'good
syncretism'. Here's some links I've found:</P>
