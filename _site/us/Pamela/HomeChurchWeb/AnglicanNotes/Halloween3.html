<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">I've never thought about &quot;celebrating&quot;
All Saint's Day! How would one start? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>All Saints Day is a Saturday this year, so we actually have time
to do something special over and above the secular All Hallow's Eve
celebrations. I enjoy making a visit with the girls to the little
heritage cemetary down by the Stampede grounds, taking flowers to the
graves of long-ago and largely forgotten little child saints who are
so sadly common in graveyards more than 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>Of course, most of the day will be rehearsals at the ballet
studio; the demands of Art recognize few holidays. Sara's pew-work
for the last couple weeks have been recommending Saints stories in
preparation for the holiday. I seem to have lost the big flat
rubbermaid box where the All-Saints periphernalia -- long-ago
home-made icons, and candle-holders dedicated to different saints
(not to mention the pumpkin carvers) -- have their home for the rest
of the year. It's odd: I can find all the other neatly labelled boxes
for Michaelmas, Advent, Christmas, Valentine's, Easter, Roodmas; but
not All Saints. I'll have to start anew, I guess. 
</P>
<P>All Saints often gets complicated because Rachel's Birthday is two
days before, and needs to be shunted onto the weekend if she's to
have a children's party. That will happen again this year.
Fortunately, she's at a point where her rehearsal schedule doesn't
get heavy until later in November, so I should be able to carry that
off.</P>
<P>We actually celebrate All Saints when we celebrate Hallowe'en:
that's what Hallowe'en means: All Saints (Hallow's) Even. The
Hallowe'en theme ghosties and dead spirits is a common-man, but sadly
uninformed, recognition of the presence of the dearly departed --
&quot;all saints&quot; -- with us in the same communion of saints.
The custom of dressing up (whatever you may have read on reactionary
Christian websites about Satanists and druids and drinking blood, or
whatever unhistorical clap-trap they've come up with this year) comes
from the medaeival custom of &quot;guising&quot;, or dressing up as
saints and biblical characters to travel from house to house to put
on miniature passion plays as a sophisticated form of begging. Kind
of like Christian door-to-door busking! It wasn't limited to
Hallowe'en, in fact it was more associated with Michaelmas, but with
the emphasis on the saints at All Saints it's fairly appropriate. 
</P>
<P>Of course, I've been trying for years to get my kiddies to choose
Saints to dress up as, and you can see how little success I've had
LOL! 
</P>
<P>As Anglicans, we believe that all Christ's baptized persons are
&quot;saints&quot; -- either saints militant like me and I presume
you, or saints triumphant like Paul and Mother Teresa and my grandma.
The Roman Catholics, who of course influence our tradition,
distinguish between Saints who have been recognized by the church
hierarchy and who are celebrated on November 1; and all the rest who
are celebrated on November 2. That's not doctrinally sound from an
Anglican perspective. But it's not entirely wrong, either. As the
third highest holy-day in the Church year (preceded by Easter and
Pentecost, but not Christmas!) All Saints is one of the feasts that
has an &quot;Octave&quot; -- that is, it is rightly celebrated for
eight days. So there's nothing wrong with continuing the celebration
from November 1 to November 2. I do object to distinguishing between
Saints recognized by Rome, and those who are not. But in most cases
it's more a matter of distinguishing between those we're pretty sure
are &quot;triumphant&quot;, and those we sure hope are &quot;triumphant&quot;.
Of course, if you believe in universal salvation even that
distinction doesn't hold. 
</P>
<P>Anything that commemorates the faithful departed -- whether
ancient Saints whom you revere, or recent saints who are dear at a
more personal level, is a good celebration of All Saints. Sara
mentions reading the stories of the Saints to her children, and
baking family recipes that were specialties of now-dead relatives.
We're going to replace some lost kiri-game (cut paper) saints icons,
and have a grave-yard picnic and take some flowers or flowerseeds to
tend some of the abandoned graves (unless it snows). Rachel's really
keen on doing something for All Saints *Day* this year, to bring it
up in importance relative to All Saints *Eve*. 
</P>
<P>All Saints is also a baptismal festival -- one of the four
preferred days for holding baptisms. So if any members of your family
were baptized on All Saints, you can celebrate their &quot;re-Birthday&quot;
with a cake, reading and reaffirming baptismal vows, and lighting
their baptismal candle.</P>
