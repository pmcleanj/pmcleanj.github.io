                <span class="fs5">As I sat through my church's communion service last week and contrasted it with the service I attended at the cathedral of St. John the Divine on Pentecost Sunday in New York, I was musing about this central rite of the Christian church and the different ways it is celebrated in different churches.  I'm not so interested in the theology--e.g. transubstantiation, Real Presence vs symbol--as in the logistics: when, where, how, what? (I have my own understanding of why which works for me, but I see all these others as being negotiable and am interested in the differences).

<P>In my church, we celebrate communion only four times a year, once a quarter.  Not associated with any holidays or holy days, just four Sabbaths roughly three months apart. It is a major service which usually takes much longer than a regular service.

<P>First, the pastor's sermon (or sermonette if he is merciful) is always related to something about Communion, to set the tone.  Then we all go downstairs and wash each other's feet, usually with men in one half of the auditorium and women in the other.  The ideal is to wash the feet of someone with whom you need to make amends, but more often people go for a newcomer or visitor, someone they don't know well or want to be particularly nice to. Or occasionally just a relative or close friend.

<P>Then we all come back upstairs and sit in every other pew. The pastor and two elders (ideally, if we have two ordained elders on hand) sit up front with the bread and &quot;wine&quot; (the wine is grape juice, served in little individual shot glasses). The pastor or an elder reads the passage about bread from 1 Corinthians 11, and then the deacons move out and start passing out bread to people.  While they do this, members of the congregation can stand and give a testimony about something they are thankful for, something God has done in their lives, etc. When everyone has the bread the pastor says a prayer and we all eat our piece.  Then ditto happens for the grape juice, with more testimonies again when the glasses are being collected (this is the only part I don't like: the little clinks are very distracting).

<P>As you might imagine, this all takes a very long time, which is why the service is so long, and I assume this, rather than any major theological reason, is why we do it so infrequently.  

<P>Anyway, after a lifetime of reading and being inspired by Anglican writers (most recently Nora Gallagher) on the beauty of the Eucharist and how meaningful it is (and comments from my friend who's recently turned Anglican about how important to him it is to receive communion every week), I thought, Yes, we should be doing this more often.  This is such a central part of the Christian life, it shouldn't just be an occasional thing.  But when comparing the two services mentioned above, mine and the Anglican one in NYC, I have to admit (and it may just be a matter of familiarity) that I LOVE the slow-paced, thoughtful way we do it.  Being moved up the aisle, to the altar, past the elements and back to the pew makes me feel like I'm on an assembly line (I realize St. John the Divine, being a HUGE church on a major Sunday, may have been more of an assembly line than most, but I have had the same feeling at other Anglican services).  I like the meditativeness of being able to sit in my pew, have it all brought to me, reflect and chew and swallow at my own pace.  And I do like the footwashing although I realize you couldn't practically do it every week.  My dad always points out that Jesus never meant &quot;wash each other's feet&quot; literally but that we should do humble acts of service for one another, and that we should do something practical like shine each other's shoes.  But I do like the archaic awkwardness of washing another person's feet.  It really does feel humble and servantlike although it's purely symbolic (nobody comes with dirty feet).

<P>There's also the little matter of wafer quality. Are all Anglican wafers as tasteless and melt-in-your mouth as the ones I got in NYC? It was gone before I got back to my seat without even the ghost of a taste to haunt me.  Ours are unleavened but very whole-grainy and chewy.  You have time to think &quot;This...is...my...body...which...was...broken...for...you&quot; before it's all gone.  And of course there's the whole grapejuice vs wine thing, which I realize depends on how strong a tradition of teetotalling your church has, but it's always a shock to me to taste alcohol in church.  

<P>Again, it's largely a matter of what's familiar I guess.  Which may make this rather a frivolous thread, but I'm interested in the differences in how different denominations and congregations do this, and why, and what's meaningful to you about it.  Interestingly the only other church I've attended much of besides my own and the Anglican, which is the Salvation Army, doesn't do communion at all--nor baptism--which makes them very odd fish for Christians.  Apparently the no-communion thing stems from Wm Booth working with alcoholics on the streets of London and not wanting to tempt them with the taste of alcohol, but I'm not sure that explanation really washes as Booth was post-Wesleyan and I think the Methodists were already well into the grape juice thing by that time.

<P>But I digress! Talk to me, talk to me about your experience of communion, eucharist, the Lord's Supper, mass, call it what you will!

            <div class="mainBodyText">
                <span class="fs5">Okay, you asked, I rambled. This is very long. &quot;My&quot; church has had so many different ways of doing things!

<P>In the church I first attended in the 1970's (pre liturgical-reform), communion was held once a month except in the Summer or when some other consideration intervened. Very often it did, so the frequency was more like four to six times a year. The main Sunday service was Morning Prayer. It was read from the 1662 prayerbook, and the psalms, canticles, creed, intercessions and Lords Prayer were all sung as corporate plainchant. A Morning Prayer service lasted about an hour.

<P>The communion services were very similar except they start on page 67 instead of page 4. Instead of canticles, we sang the decalogue, and the Gospel was preceeded and followed by a chanted proclaimation (which does not occur at Morning Prayer). After the sermon (which for practical purposes is the end of Morning Prayer) there would be an offertory procession, as robed acolytes brought up the people's offerings, and uncovered the hosts and wine on the altar. Then we would all kneel, while the priest sang the Sursum Corda in Sarum plainsong (which is stylisticly different from plainchant, but impossible to explain over the internet). He (always &quot;he&quot; -- this was prior to the ordination of the second Anglican woman priest) would then recite the Prayer of consecration with the congregation still kneeling, and would communicate himself. He would then serve communion to the acolytes and deacons while the choir sang the chang &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. Then the choir would come up to the altar to communicate. When they went back, one choir member always remained kneeling in the center, as a marker between the two sides of the church who each communicated on their own side of the altar rail. Starting with the front row, people left their pews by the centre aisle, walked up to the altar-rail, knelt. When the rail  was full, the priest would pass along it, placing the bread into the precisely-cupped hands of each communicant to the words &quot;The Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee, preserve thy body and soul to everlasting life. Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ Jesus died for thee, and feed on him in thy heart, with thanksgiving&quot;. The deacon followed him serving the wine from a common chalice with the words &quot;The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul to everlasting life. Drink this, all of ye, in remembrance that Christ's Blood was shed for thee, and be thankful.&quot; Each person grasped the chalice in the precisely correct way. When each person has received both bread and wine, she would stand and return to her pew by the side aisle, and kneel until everyone has communicated.  Throughout the communion, the choir sang anthems in four- and six-part harmony. They would fall silent while the priest performed the ablutions after communion; then their last anthem would be the most ornate, after everyone had returned to their pews. Then there would be more chants -- the Lord's Prayer a second time to a different chant mode, a Thanksgiving, the Gloria, and the Peace blessing followed by a four-fold chanted Amen. Everything was slow, venerable and ornate: the Elizabethan language, the ancient music, the rich embroidered robes and heavy richly decorated platen and chalice.  Although we cycled past the altar, it never felt remotely like an assembly line, and the long kneeling vigil before and after your turn to go up left you plenty of time to meditate. This all took about ninety minutes.

<P>Liturgical reform brought us more frequent communion (typically every second Sunday) and alternation between the Traditional rite and various experimental rites. We were experimenting with ecumenism, too, so I attended Roman Catholic and United eucharists. So much is a matter of &quot;what you're used to&quot;: the RC's were beginning to take communion in the hand but without kneeling down and without sharing the cup. To me that seemed demeaning and assembly-line, and it certainly is very much quicker than kneeling in turn (which is *not* a virtue, from my perspective). The United Church used cubes of store-bought white bread and little inch-high paper cups of grape juice, passed around on a tray. Each person took one of each, and passed on the tray. Then the minister said a prayer, and everyone ate together. White-bread made me think, irreverantly, &quot;how appropriate&quot; and the purple grape juice made me think of the infamous grape koolaid of the same era. 

<P>Anglican contemporary rite follow largely the same pattern as the traditional rites. The language is no longer Elizabethan, and the robes and hangings were more typically ethnic embroidery, funky applique, or homespun and batik. The silver platen and chalice were replaced by earthy pottery. The liturgical prayers became said (because chant music hadn't been written yet for the new language) and &quot;folk hymns&quot; with acoustic guitars replaced the organ music. Some of what we did in those days was deep and meaningful: the eucharist became &quot;ours&quot;; the new trappings were still of the highest quality and steeped in meaning; in some aspects old meaningless customs were stripped away to reveal the purity of the underlying tradition. The return to weekly communion, with Morning Prayer as a *daily* office, is an example of such a change. The procession of the bread and wine by the laity is another example: instead of keeping the bread and wine in the sacristy, it is brought up ahead of the money gifts -- taking the emphasis off the offering of money, and underscoring the role of the laity in the eucharist. Often now, the bread brought up is home-baked -- a definate improvement over the pressed-cardboard wavers -- or whole-wheat wafers are used (so no, they're not *all* the same horrid white pasteboard).

<P>Some of what we did in those days was shoddy, and lost the dignity and contemplative tone of the older service. Some churches met change with reactionary responses: either returning to the Elizabethan language exclusively and trying to ignore the women priests and bishops, twentieth-century music, cutting-edge Bible scholarship, and other forces of change; or pushing change even further, altering the fundamental form of the eucharist, inventing new creeds and introducing non-Biblical liturgical texts, bringing electric guitars, drum-kits and keyboards into the sanctuary and replacing the choir anthems with performance-style praise-and-worship music. Because the traditional service is inherently slow, quiet and dignified; the typical &quot;contemporary&quot; service ends up being more of the, uh, &quot;exuberant&quot; style. The contemporary liturgy *can* be done in a contemplative style, but it rarely is. 

<P>The CCM church we now attend is a very exuberant style. Even though we have Eucharist every week, I find it less rewarding than the oldstyle occasional service. The long prayerful silence during the eucharist is eroded by the upbeat music; and after a half-hour or more of praise-and-worship music, the actual consecration and communion nearly get lost. In our Lutheran church, before we began our CCM sojourn with the local Anglican congregation, we had eucharist only twice a month. The music, although still praise-and-worship rock, was not as greatly amplified and was a slightly folksier style. Even so, the eucharist often got lost, largely because the priest never used a full prayer of consecration but only the minimal words of institution. Some Lutheran pastors insist on this minimal consecration because the rest of the prayer of consecration is non-biblical and therefor idolatrous. People who know our pastor better than I tell me his reason for using it was to get us out the door in under an hour. 

<P>Like the Anglican church, the Lutheran practice is for communicants to go up to the altar rail, kneel, and receive there; then return to their pews. Our church always used a fresh loaf from the Italian bakery: crusty and chewy. Afterward, the leftovers were set out with the coffee-hour refreshments, and any left after that was tossed in the trash. I've seen people slather butter onto the consecrated bread to have it with their coffee. That appals me. We didn't use the common cup, but were each handed a glass thimbleful to drain at the altar and then drop into a basket carried for the purpose by an acolyte who followed the minister. Thimbles contained either wine or grape-juice, and you could choose which you wanted. In another Lutheran church we attended, that had a circular central chancel, we stood (rather than kneeling) around the altar. You could take the wine from a common cup, but it had a pour-spout on the side so that you could have an individual glass if you wanted. Glass thimbles of grape juice were also carried around for those who didn't want wine -- *three* choices. In other Lutheran churches, you carry away your little glass and place it on trays located by the side-aisle for that purpose, or there are trays built onto the back of the altar-rail: you take a clean cup from the right, the minister pours wine or grape-juice into it, and when you have drunk you stack the dirty cups on the left. As a newcomer or visitor, you'll want to take careful note of whether the clean cups are right or left, and whether it's the clean ones or the dirty ones that are upside down. I find having to figure things like that out gets in the way of a prayerful communion, but of course only visitors have that problem.

<P>The best liturgical communions are at monasteries. Nothing is rushed or loud. Everyone knows their part, after the first day or so there's nothing to figure out. Often, communion is daily, but so deep and quiet that the whole day leading to it and from it just seems to be an adjunct to the eucharist. And then, the retreat ends and you have to go deal with real life again!</span>

LOL  It was a very traditional church that loved Rite I with it's beautiful old language and didn't take well to the more contemporary language of Rite II, even though it was still treated the same.  Same slow, dignified service, same organ music.  Ahhhh, those were the good ol' days.  Father Frank was assisted by an acolyte (for several years that was me) except for passing the chalice.  We used a common cup, real wine (usually a strong Hearty Burgundy; Father Frank wanted you to literally *feel* the blood of Christ! LOL) and went to the altar to receive.  He taught that Communion should ideally be received every day, but once a week would suffice.  As for those leftovers I referred to above, I remember clearly being fed leftover host by the handful! LOL

<P>The parish (technically mission) that we most recently were active in did things basically the same way except for no acolytes, and the Deacon acted as chalice-bearer.

            <div class="mainBodyText">
                <span class="fs5">I have a varied communion experience.

<P>I have had communion with my family, on a mountain ridge, that consisted of homemade wheat bread and grape juice taken with prayer and a mix of Gujurati and Hindi choruses, Youth For Christ songs, and hymns.

<P>I wasn't allowed communion in the Baptist Church (celebrated once a month) because I was not baptized.

<P>In later churches of various denominations, communion was once a month. It was made with little pillows of cracker and purple grape juice. LEading up to the communion was a set of prayers and Bible readings which emphasized that we must take communion with clean hearts and intentions or else the wrath of God would be upon us. The elders passed trays of crackers which we held and took together with the statement &quot;Do this in remembrance of me.&quot; Any child could take communion if their parents thought they were ready. I often didn't take communion even when I was in high school because I worried that my heart was not clear. Then the elders passed trays of glasses with grape juice and we drank the juice all together at the statement. Cups went in little holders in each pew. Then hymns were sung while we filed quietly out of the building.

<P>In my current church, there is a service every day but no longer communion every day (though if people come to the service it may be offered); 2 days a week there is Morning Prayer instead. M-Saturday (and Sunday at 8am) the service is &quot;low mass&quot;. There is communion but the whole service is spoken (not sung) and there is no choir or organ. The service lasts about an hour if there is a sermon. Sunday at 10am the service lasts 1.5-2 hours (less in summer or if a visiting priest is in charge).

<P>I usually go to 10 service. I like to sit in the back but my kids like the front - this makes a difference to mediation time. In front I get plenty of after meditation time but in the back I get some before and some after. After the sermon, Nicene Creed, Prayers of the people, confess our sins, pass the Peace, and announcements, two members of the congregation take the bread and wine up to the altar. The ushers collect the offerings and take them to the altar where all three offerings are blessed. The ushers and element bearers return to their seats, closing the altar rail behind them. We say the Great Thanksgiving, sing &quot;Holy&quot;. The priest consecrates the bread and wine; this is done is a sure and reverential way, taking time but not dragging on. The words are clear to everyone in the church. We say the Lord's Prayer, we sing Agnus Dei. We say both &quot;Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the feast&quot; and &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof but speak the word only and my soul shall be healed.&quot; The choir sings a last verse or two of psalm and then comes forward to receive as the priest has communion and gives it to the servers. After the choir we go up and kneel along the altar rail. After the choir receives, they sing an anthem (never bouncy). We may kneel or stand, we may receive in our hands or on our tongues. The wine is in two cups and one may guide the cup with one hand or touch the cup with one hand and not take the wine. The communion sentence ocassionaly changes. We return to our seats and kneel or sit. There is a communion hymn. The ushers withdraw the altar rail. We pray our thanksgiving. The priest gives a blessing. **At this point we used to have another Bible reading called &quot;The Second Gospel&quot; which was from John 1:1 but that has been removed over the last few years because people felt it made the service too long. &lt;rolls eyes&gt; We sing another hymn as the Priest and servers recess. We kneel and pray as the servers return to the sacristy.

            <div class="mainBodyText">
                <span class="fs5">A resume of Holy Communion in my church:

<P>Age limit: None. If you (and presumably your parents) feel that you're ready, join us. It is God who does the calling. If you want to go, you've been &quot;invited.&quot;

<P>Membership requirement: None. Anyone who feels him/herself to be a part of the body of Christ is welcome.

<P>Frequency: Once a month, on the first Sunday. This seems a bit arbitrary to me, so I suspect it is for practical reasons.

<P>What: Bread and grape juice. The rationale for the juice is that alcohol might be a barrier to some. The bread is usually leavened and often (horrifyingly) something I suspect is Wonder bread. I much prefer the tasteless Episcopalian wafers of my childhood. In the summer, when there are fewer people to serve, each communicant pulls off hunks of wheat bread, an unfortunate practice because sometimes you get a heck of a lot more than a mouthful. The grape juice is served in tiny cups.

<P>Where: At the altar rail, on our knees. We take turns going up in rows.

<P>Whom: The elements are consecrated by our full time male and part-time female pastor, then served by lay people as well as the pastors.

<P>How: We follow the standard &quot;service of word and table II&quot; in the UMC hymnal. 

<P>Comment: I don't really have strong preferences regarding communion, except this one: I believe it should be open to all professing Christians, regardless of their denomination. I am never comfortable in a church where I or my children cannot commune. I also like the practice of serving grape juice instead of wine: no one should be barred from the table of Christ! Besides, I like my Holy Spirit buzz to be distinct from my Sauvignon Blanc buzz!
