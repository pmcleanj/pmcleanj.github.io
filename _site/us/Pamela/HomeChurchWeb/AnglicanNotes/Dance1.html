</P>
<P>One of the biggest lessons of the time I spent actively involved
in liturgical dance, is that God never gives all the cards to one
person. When God is acting through God's people, god usually gives
part of the inspiriation to one member of the community, another part
to another member, and so on. In Choros Charieis, we eventually
learned that no-one got to &quot;be the choreographer&quot; for any
piece: one person would be drawn to a certain music, another person
to a theme, another person to a set of visual images or shapes. We
could either keep our ideas to ourselves thinking that everyone else
was coming up with such good ideas that they didn't need ours -- or
we could argue about whose idea to go with, which, alas, we did,
especially at first! -- or we could screw up our courage and offer up
the missing piece.
