<P>Science and Faith: Compatible but Separate. (warning, long!)</P>
<P>I am often torn two ways, by both my sisters-in-Christ and by my
working brothers in my professional, by comments that are discounting
to whichever portion of my philosophical life that person doesn't
share. I believe it is possible to be both rigourously scientific,
and devoutly faithful, without any internal conflict. As a scientist
-- applied, at least -- myself, I offer the following essay for
consideration: 
</P>
<P>A respected scientist recently condemned Christianity as
&quot;essentially irrational&quot;. I frequently hear the assertion
that &quot;science has disproved Christianity&quot;. On the other
hand I hear about &quot;the faithless arrogance of scientists&quot;
or that science teachers, in teaching something that is &quot;just a
theory&quot;, are engaged in an assault against Christianity. Caught
in the middle are Christian scientists (as opposed to Christian
Scientists &lt;g&gt;) who occasionally claim that in fact science
supports or even proves the claims of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>I contend that all three of these perspectives betray a basic
misunderstanding of the nature of faith, science, and the
relationship between them. 
</P>
<P>Yes, faith is irrational. So are oranges, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;,
and pi. &quot;Irrational&quot; is not an inherently negative term; it
simply refers to something that cannot be systematicly reduced to a
root concept or idea. Why would we be offended at the claim that our
faith cannot be reduced? The great modern theologians like Emmanuel
Kant recognised this in the concept of &quot;the leap of faith&quot;;
we make such leaps on a regular basis. Is play rational? Is love
rational? No. But they are none-the-less real. 
</P>
<P>Why, for that matter, would someone expect faith to follow the
rules of &quot;rationality&quot; that are appropriate to an entirely
different domain of hman experience, to whit, science? For the most
part, that notion begins with the theologian/mathematician Rene
Descartes. Descartes, of &quot;I think, therefor I am&quot; fame,
nearly single-handedly transformed the philosophy of the western
world. His concept of the number-line demonstrated that arithmetic
clearly has no limits at either positive or negative infinity.
Although arithmetic has no intrinsic reality -- it is only a
self-consistent analytical system -- it is used in daily experience
to help us understand *reality*. If arithmetic demonstrates that no
&quot;first cause&quot; is necessary, then how can we claim that
*reality's* need for a &quot;first cause&quot; proves the existence
of God? 
</P>
<P>By combining two or three number-lines, Descartes created
&quot;Cartesian planes&quot; and &quot;Cartesian spaces&quot; in
which arithmetic could be used to study shapes and solids. At a
simplistic level, this suggested another &quot;proof&quot; for the
existence of God: that as an (infinite) plane is required to contain
an (infinite) line, and a space is required to contain a plane, so
eventually one must come to a &quot;first context&quot; which
sustains all subordinate contexts. Some Christian theologians adopted
this concept of the &quot;first context&quot; to replace the &quot;first
cause&quot; argument, but no great mathematical insight is required
to see that they are manifestations of the same idea, and subject to
the same fallacy. A more important effect of this new mathematics was
that it broke forever the previously-impervious barrier between
algebraic reasoning and Euclidean reasoning. If that impervious
barrier could be broken, why not the barrier between philosophy and
science? Could not science and mathematics be used to describe
*everything*? Hence the Age of Reason was born, with Rene Descartes
as its father. Christian apologists, few of whom understood the
rational of their aruguments with anything approaching Descarte's
acuity, began explaining to the world how science &quot;proved&quot;
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>Descartes himself did not buy in to the fallacies of the Age of
Reason. &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; (I think, therefor I am) is
*not* a rational argument. It does not &quot;prove&quot; the
existance of God, nor does it intend to. Yet, it is essentially
&quot;scientific&quot;. Because SCIENCE IS NOT ABOUT PROOF! Science
is not about &quot;facts&quot;. Science is a method!!! 
</P>
<P>The scientific method is as follows: the scientist makes careful,
detailed *observations*. &quot;Observations&quot; are the only part
of science that has an inarguable claim to be &quot;fact&quot;. A
fact is something like &quot;an apple, held at a distance above the
ground and then released, accellerates toward the ground&quot;. The
scientist then imagines a theory that explains the observation: &quot;an
invisible attractive force acts between two masses&quot;, and may
have to create certain definitions as part of the theory: &quot;that
force being called gravity&quot;. The scientist then uses his theory
to predict some *different* behaviour than has previously been
observed, and sets up certain conditions in which that behaviour
*can* be observed. An experiment is never a &quot;failure&quot;,
whether the predicted behaviour is observed or not, as long as it
adds to the body of &quot;observations&quot; from which new theories
can be imagined. In fact, the experiments that non-scientists
consider &quot;failures&quot; are the most exciting, because the
scientist must then refine his theory, or create a new one, that
adequately explains *all* the observations. The experiments must also
be repeatable by different scientists, so that the observations are
utterly objective. Scientific theories are continually being refined,
as we add to humanities experience. A shallow or simplistic
understanding of a theory can usually be shown to have multiple
flaws; but the advanced scientific statement of the theory is always
considerably more robust. 
</P>
<P>We should all be concerned if our science teachers are teaching
theory as fact. Not because theories are suspect -- the atomic theory
of matter, the theory of gravity, magnetic field theory, and so on
are all &quot;just&quot; theories -- but because teaching &quot;fact&quot;
instead of &quot;method&quot; presupposes that answers are more
important than questions. And when we stop questioning, science
stops. Even -- or perhaps especially -- when a theory challenges the
teachings of our religion, our children benefit from examining both
the observations that the theory explains, and the testing that the
theory has undergone. A theory may be the simplest explaination of
all available observations, and still be wrong. 
</P>
<P>Should the same method be applied to our faith? Should we build
theories based on doctrine or dogma, and then apply them to rigorous
testing to set faith up as a competitor to Science? I say, with
Descartes, a hearty &quot;No&quot;. Science is utterly objective;
faith occurs inside our hearts, the gift of grace, utterly
subjective. Science and faith are as different as &quot;taste&quot;
and &quot;sleep&quot; -- neither related, nor complementary, nor
mutually exclusive. To hold one up in condemnation of the other is
specious. 
</P>
<P>I experience Jesus in an utterly personal way. That is not
Science. It is the essence of Faith.
