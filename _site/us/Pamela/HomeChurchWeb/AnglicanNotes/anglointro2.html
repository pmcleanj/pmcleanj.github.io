<P>If this is too complicated a question, just let me know! My son
attends an Episcopalian school, including chapel twice a week. I am
Baptist, and though I know quite a bit about Catholics, and I know
that the Episcopal faith stems from Catholic faith, I don't know
exactly what the differences are. I'd rather not get into disussing
my errors in educating him Episcopalian when we are Baptist.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>I love complex questions...</P>
<P>I'm going to refer to the &quot;Anglican&quot; church here. That's
the same as Episcopalian. 
</P>
<P>The Anglican church is part of the &quot;Church Catholic&quot;,
just as is the Roman Catholic Church. The latter is probably what you
mean when you say &quot;Catholic&quot;. When we say the &quot;Catholic
Church&quot; we mean &quot;The whole company of Christian believers&quot;.
We believe that includes Baptists too, although we recognise that you
have lost, or reject, portions of the Christian faith that we value:
specifically our understanding of Sacrament and Tradition. We don't
so much derive from the Roman Catholic Church; as do the Roman
Catholic, and Anglo Catholic Churches derive from the same common
source: the early apostolic church. 
</P>
<P>The *Roman* catholic church believes in central authority from
Rome (the Magisterium and the Pope). We do not recognise the Pope as
having any authority except for the authority he holds as Bishop of
Rome (that is, over his own See and the churches within it). You'll
sometimes read in the news that the Archbishop of Cantebury is the
&quot;head&quot; of the Anglican church, equivalent to the Pope, but
that is a misunderstanding that the press may never become clear on.
The only &quot;head&quot; of the Church that we recognise, is Christ.
We do recognise the authority of individual Bishops over the churches
under them: that is part of our understanding of Sacrament and
Tradition. 
</P>
<P>This independence of Bishops means that the Anglican church allows
more variation in belief and practice than is obvious in the Roman
Catholic church. You will find Anglican churches that are nearly
indistinguishable from Roman churches, and also Anglican churches
that are indistinguishable from Evangelical churches, and a full
range in between. The main things that will stand out for you, as a
Baptist, are: 
</P>
<P>- Like the Roman Catholics, we believe in Sacraments, in
particular Baptism and Holy Communion. We believe that these are
joint acts of God and Man, and have sacred power beyond their
relevance as symbols, signs or memorials. Some Baptists (right here
on the internet) have called me personally Satan's tool for saying
so, but we believe that &quot;being born of water and the Spirit&quot;
refers to the act of baptism. So we are saved *through* baptism, not
baptised in recognition of being saved. Shocking, eh what?&lt;g&gt; 
</P>
<P>- The jury is still out on the other &quot;sacraments&quot;:
marriage, confirmation, orders, unction and reconciliation. The Roman
Catholic central authority declares them to be sacraments; we get to
debate the issue because we have no central authority. 
</P>
<P>- Like the Roman Catholic Church, we believe in the Communion of
the Saints. That means we believe the Church Militant (you and me)
and the Church Triumphant (those who have died and are risen in
Christ) are all part of the body together, dependent on one another
as members of the same body. We hold up the example of our pious
predecessors by naming them Saints and studying their example. Unlike
Rome, we have no central authority to decide who gets to be called
Saint and who doesn't, so we gradually form a concensus. 
</P>
<P>- Like the Roman Catholic church, we believe we can find
revelation outside of the Bible: in Tradition and Reason. Since we
have no central authority to dictate to us what dogmas may be
considered &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot; we
examine Scripture, Tradition and Reason together, to be sure that
they do not conflict with one another. In the Catholic church this
examination is done by the Magisterium, who take the place of
Tradition (or of Reason) in this so-called &quot;three-legged chair&quot;.
</P>
<P>- Like the Roman Catholic church, we use a liturgical form of
worship: one in which the laypeople have a clearly defined role:
saying or singing certain prayers and acclaimations in a prescribed
order. &quot;Liturgy&quot; is derived from words meaning &quot;the
work of the common people&quot;. Unlike the Roman Catholic church,
there is considerable variety in the precise forms followed by
different churches, and considerable freedom to improvise. 
</P>
<P>Personally, I don't see any errors in your sending him to an
Episcopalian school. Anglican schools in general have a superbe
record for quality education, and as I said at the top, your son is
as much a part of the Church as any of us.
