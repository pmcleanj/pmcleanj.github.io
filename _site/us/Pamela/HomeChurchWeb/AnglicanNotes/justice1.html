<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">What is our Christian responsibility when we
see other Christians treating nonbelievers badly? </FONT>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Spirit has given each of us different gifts. One of them is
the gift of standing up for Justice ....</P>
<P>Sometimes it is enough simply to live a Christian calling openly
and unashamedly. To me, that means to pray and study the bible
without apology to my &quot;more enlightened&quot; atheist colleagues
and friends; and ALSO to speak out for justice for divorcees,
homosexuals, and non-Christians without apology to my &quot;more
devout&quot; Christian colleagues and friends. Indeed, if the
majority of Christians were convicted to be open about both their
Christianity and their tolerance for the people around them, the
stereotypes of the judgemental, intolerant Christian might die a
natural death. There would still be nasty Christians -- because we
are, like any human group, a mixed bag of sinners -- but the
non-believers who encountered such nastiness would recognize it for
the exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>Simply to BE and BE overtly is also a gift. But, by itself, it
turns out it's not enough. It might be enough to convince
non-believers that we're not all bad, but it doesn't minister to them
and restore the dignity that the nastiness assaulted. It also doesn't
minister to the person who committed the nastiness, or to their pawns
(ifor example, employees who are committing injustice in the mistaken
belief that it represents a &ldquo;worthy&rdquo; corporate policy).
The gift of simply living with integrity needs to be bolstered by
those who have the gift of speaking out, and those who have the gift
of reaching out. And by those who have the gift of prayer for the
healing of the two communities that have been violated by the
injustices you recount. 
</P>
<P>We cannot simply reject the person who mistakenly commits
unjustice in Christ's name. Perhaps, if we belonged to some other
affiliation, we could simply point and say &quot;look, he's the
minority; he's not *really* one of us&quot;. But, our calling is to
healing and inclusion. Somehow -- and I don't have the answer to how
-- we need to seek a response that offers regret and restitution to
the victims of Christian-perpetrated injustice; and *also* offers
reconciliation and forgiveness to the perpetrator.
