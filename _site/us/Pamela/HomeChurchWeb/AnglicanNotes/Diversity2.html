<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">Who are *real* Christians these days? Anyone
these days can call themselves a Christian whether they are or not. A
humanistic Christian, a Wiccan Christian. I mean come on!!! What's
going on here? What about the old fashion Christian that is talked
about in the bible?  I'd rather call myself &ldquo;Born Again&rdquo;,
as I'm no longer comfortable calling myself &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;</FONT></P>

<P>Probably the same people they have always been ...</P>
<P>The members of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the middle east. 
</P>
<P>That, at least, is the church with the oldest unbroken historical
record, located still the cultural mileau most similar to the
cultural mileau of first-century Palestine. So, I would guess that
they are the best example of &quot;the old fashion Christian that is
talked about in the bible&quot;. And yes, they are still around
today. 
</P>
<P>The Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox, and Roman Catholics also have
some pretty good claims to being &quot;the old fashion Christian that
is talked about in the bible&quot; except for the very different
cultural mileus that shape their worship. They, too, are still around
today and in fact, well over half of all Christians belong to these
traditions and maintain their ancient ways traceable back to those
first-century biblical Christians. 
</P>
<P>Are those who follow modern variations on these ancient ways --
you know: Pentacostals, Baptists, Methodists, Assemblies of God, and
so on -- &quot;*real* Christians&quot;? *I* believe they are.
Although I disagree with many of the concepts that these
self-proclaimed &quot;Christians&quot; have merged with the historic
faith, I recognize that they follow the same Master I follow. I
recognize that; to the extent that they do, in my Master's name, feed
the hungry, visit the prisoners, care for the widows and orphans;
they too do the work of my Master's Father in Heaven and that my
Master therefor calls them -- despite their heretical beliefs -- his
brothers and sisters. None of us is perfect in understanding and
doctrine (&lt;g&gt; except Anglicans, of course&lt;g&gt;) so it makes
sense not to begrudge people the right to call themselves Christian
just because I, in my imperfect understanding, disagree with them. 
</P>
<P>I have met Christian humanists and Christian witches. It's
probably better for us to *listen* to them explain their own beliefs,
than to presume to proclaim on their behalf what they believe. Where
there are no Christian humanists or Christian witches to ask, then I
guess their purported existence isn't that relevant, is it. 
</P>
<P>In the meantime, if someone wants to call himself Christian, who
is has the right to stop him? No-one can say &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot;
except by the Power of the Spirit.
