<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">I am interested in purchasing a book or two
for my 3 yr old. He is very interested in mommy's Bible but he loses
interest very quickly if I read from it to him.Any suggestions on a
book or books that I could purchase for him?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">My favourite for early readers is the
Contemporary English Version...</FONT></P>
<P>I never allowed bible story-books in the nursery, having a strong
aversion to them from what I had observed in doctor's waiting-rooms
and Sunday-School libraries: shallow, inaccurate paraphrases of
Scripture with heavy-handed morals, often at odds with the deeper
lessons of scripture. 
</P>
<P>I have a collection of beautifully illustrated Bible *excerpts*
using mostly direct authoritative translations; one does use a
paraphrase but a very careful one: Tomei de Paolo, Sandal Stoddard,
Tony Chen, and so on. The American Bible published several
illustrated extracts from the CEV that were our mainstay for the
preschool years. When Anne learned to read I got her this one: 
</P>
<P><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=1016822253/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4892195-0380161">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=1016822253/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4892195-0380161</A>
</P>
<P>(There, that should screw up the page formatting for this post!
&lt;g&gt;) 
</P>
<P>The illustrations are bright and realistic without being highly
detailed or formal, and show average semitic people instead of
uniformly tall handsome nordic people. 
</P>
<P>The text is extremely readable, and is a direct translation from
original texts into the familiar language of a non-expert
English-speaker. It's also my preferred text in most cases for
reading Scripture aloud, since it permits the meaning to be followed
easily by the majority of the audience. For rigourous study, more
subtle and scholarly translations are preferable, but most serious
students use more than one translation anyway. When your daughter is
ten or twelve, you can get her another to supplement the CEV. 
</P>
<P>I'm a big fan of the Contemporary English Version...</P>
<P>The Contemporary English Version is a direct translation from the
original text into a simple vocabulary suitable for unsophisticated
readers. The American Bible Society has published some beautifully
illustrated extracts from it that appeal well to children, as well as
a complete bible (either protestant or Roman Catholic). 
</P>
<P>Once dd8 was reading I got her the whole CEV illustrated bible,
which is available in both protestant and Roman Catholic versions.

<P>For yonger children, the ABS has added a set of colouring books
using the CEV text and a book with Gospel extracts. (They used to
have a lovely set of the CEV gospels and Acts, each in a separate
volume with charming illustrations, which I used extensively, but
they are alas now out of print.) They also have a book of shorter
extracts, &quot;A book about Jesus&quot;.

<P>The illustrations in this version aren't very attractive -- or
scripturally sound -- so I didn't buy it, ans hence haven't used it
and can't speak to the quality of the translation. The concept of
translating directly for children is interesting, but the result
could be very good or very bad, or anywhere inbetween. The poor
illustrations aren't a good sign.

<P>The Contemporary English Version and the 1662 Book of Common
Prayer</P>
<P>I like to use an actual scripture translation rather than a
bible-story book, in order to keep the story-book author's
interpretive bias from affecting the way the children receive the
stories. However Sandol Stoddard's and Tony Chen's lovely book A
Child's First Bible Storybook is faithful to the biblical text while
presenting stories in a short, stunningly illustrated format. I used
the earlier edition of this with my dd's when they were babies.

</P>
<P>I am not a fan of &quot;kiddie&quot; prayers and songs. For
devotions we simply use the Traditional ancient prayers of the
church, the same that are used for adults. We started with the
simplest prayers, combining them with extempore prayer. Children are
excellent rote learners as you know if you have ever mis-read a word
in their favourite story-book; so it doesn't take them long to add a
new prayer or hymn to their repertoire. Since the Traditional prayers
are rich in scriptural references, this technique writes the words of
Scripture in their hearts. We taught them one at a time, starting
with Nunc Dimittus (&quot;Lord lettest now thy servant depart in
peace&quot;), since that is in &quot;A book about Jesus&quot; and the
children had already learned it just from hearing the story over and
over. The Lord's Prayer was one of the next, and Kontakion -- I can't
remember which they learned first. 
</P>
<P>But that being said, someone gave Anne a copy of Classic
Children's Prayers
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564</A>
(which I tried to ignore) and both children have memorized all the
prayers in it and use them freely, so you might find such a thing a
good resource. It's a board book, so the children can play with it
and take ownership of it, without wearing it out. While I was looking
for the reference at Amazon I also found this beautiful book
containing some of the same prayers, and more:
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564</A>

<P>For yourself, I think what you're looking for is more a Bible
Companion than a concordance. 
</P>
<P>A concordance is for looking up words in the bible, and how they
were translated. If, for example, you remember a fragment of a quote,
you can look up one of the words from the quote in your concordance
and it will give you all the passages where that word occurs. The
best-known English concordance is Strong's, which is a concordance of
the King James Version. It also contains notes about how the
individual Hebrew and Greek words were translated by the KJV
translators. You can get this function online and save your money:
one of my favourite such sites is the Blue Letter Bible:
<A HREF="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</A>
</P>
<P>Another tool you might be thinking of, is a commentary. A
commentary is a set of notes on the passages of Scripture. It is
arranged book by book, chapter by chapter, verse by verse; so that as
you read along in the Bible you can also see what various scholars
have to say about the passage you are reading. Here's a previous
discussion of commentaries: 
</P>
<P><A HREF="http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html">http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html</A>
</P>
<P>Note that that discussion was in the context of quite scholarly
commentaries. It is actually easier to find simpler and more readable
commentaries than it is to find the hard ones. 
</P>
<P>A bible companion, or a bible history or bible atlas helps you
find the cultural, historical, and geographic context around the
events that you are reading about. It may not deal with the passage
itself, but will tell you about the countries, climates, and culture
in which the passage was written. Here's one that several people have
recommended (I don't have one myself):
