<P><FONT COLOR="#280099">What are the Bible readings that you post
each week, and what does &ldquo;RCL&rdquo; stand for?.  </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4>Answer: </FONT>
</P>
<P>The RCL, or &ldquo;Revised Common Lectionary&rdquo;,  replaced the
&quot;Common Lectionary&quot; back in the 1980's which grew out of
the ecumenical and liturgical reform efforts of the 1970's. The
Common Lectionary was intended to give all catholics -- us, RC's,
Lutheran's, etc -- a common ground by exploring Scripture in our
Sunday worship together. It was an international and
interdenominational effort. The big change for Anglicans was we *got*
old testament readings (the 1662 service had only an epistle and a
gospel), and it takes three years to cycle through the readings
instead of one (for the eucharistic readings) or two (for the Daily
Office). The three readings and the psalm were linked by a common
theme. The theme was drawn from the Gospels, which were followed more
or less sequentially; one synoptic per year with John for festivals
on all three years. Drawing the theme from the gospels meant that the
old testament stories were chopped up, and almost never heard
completely or in sequence. There were other deficiencies that lead to
the revision of the CL. The end result is that churches that
completed their liturgical reform early ended up with the CL in their
prayerbooks, whereas those who worked out of pamphlets and flyers for
an extra decade got the *R*CL in the prayerbooks. From what I glean
from my Liturgy e-list, most churches use the RCL and just use their
bulletins to alert the congregation to the readings instead of
relying on the listing in the prayer book. 
</P>
<P>The RCL includes the option of a thematic pattern of OT readings,
or a sequential pattern of OT readings. The psalm is linked to the
choice of OT reading; the epistle remains linked to the Gospel
reading. Then, some national or denominational churches made
adjustments to the RCL for their own special needs. So now within our
&quot;common&quot; lectionary readings we have the differences
between the CL and the RCL, the different choices of OT reading
pattern, and the different church-specific variations. But it's a not
bad attempt at consistency, none-the-less. 
</P>
<P>I get the RCL readings from the Vanderbilt Library site,

<P>The Episcopal Sunday readings (according to
<A HREF="http://www.satucket.com/lectionary/index.htm">http://www.satucket.com/lectionary/index.htm</A>,
which is not an official church website and so could be totally out
to lunch) seem to be a subset of the RCL readings. For example, last
week the Episcopal Sunday reading left out the middle part of the
Mark reading and skipped straight from one half of the Jairus story
to the other. Next week the gospel ends at verse 6 where the RCL
carries on to verse 13. The corresponding Daily Office readings are
quite different -- Mark 1 instead of Mark 6 for this coming Sunday.
