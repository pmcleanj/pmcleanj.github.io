<P><!-- OldURL: http://boards.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann1/2/2.html -->The
Woman at the Well, or how Duende and Lulul are going to get me
expelled from Bible Study&hellip;</P>
<P>As I've said before, the main problem with the child-friendly
Lutheran church I've found is that the pastor - and hence the
preaching - are a good deal more sin-and-judgement focussed than my
own theology tends to be. And with my well-known lack of tact and
subservience, it's not surprising that Pastor has begun to flinch
slightly whenever he sees me coming - though he covers it well. But
today we did John 4.3-26 in Bible study. 
</P>
<P>For those who don't have a bible handy, here's the passage
<A HREF="http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Jhn/Jhn004.html#top">http://www.khouse.org/blueletter/Jhn/Jhn004.html#top</A>
or, for those who prefer a modern translation,
<A HREF="http://search.absblc.org/versesearch.asp?selversion=cev&amp;selbook=43&amp;txtchapter=4&amp;txtverse=3&amp;txtchapter2=4&amp;txtverse2=26&amp;submit1.x=42&amp;submit1.y=22">http://search.absblc.org/versesearch.asp?selversion=cev&amp;selbook=43&amp;txtchapter=4&amp;txtverse=3&amp;txtchapter2=4&amp;txtverse2=26&amp;submit1.x=42&amp;submit1.y=22</A>
. The usual exegesis is, 'wasn't Jesus great for reaching out to this
women in spite of her string of failed marriages and her currently
&quot;living in sin&quot; with her latest love-interest.' It's always
pointed out that the timing of her visit to the well during the heat
of the day rather than in the cool of the morning, indicates that she
is a social outcast, more proof that she is a sinner. Not evidence
that she is a victim of a sinfully legalistic society, oh no! Note
her apparent knowledge of scripture, and the flexibility of her mind
in going one-on-one in theology with a Rabbi - rarely mentioned in
Bible Study. No mention in exegesis either of Jesus' obvious delight
in her quick wit and interest. And certainly no acknowledgement of
her culturally-limited power to decide whom she was to be married off
to next. 
</P>
<P>Pastor's addition this morning was that it shows Jesus obviously
didn't approve of common-law marriage (like, hunh?), and that her
string of divorces indicated she was seeking to fill a spiritual void
(likewise, hunh?). We have no way to know if she was a widow or a
divorcee! We always assume a divorcee (it lets us luxuriate a little
more in our sense of superiority over her) but what if she was passed
down from kinsman to kinsman like the hypothetical woman in Matthew
22.23-28? How objectifying! What if the latest of those kinsmen
didn't really want her, but didn't set her free either? What if this
legalistic violation of social justice had left her in a perpetual
limbo between the economic and emotional security of marriage, and
the freedom to form a satisfying liaison (as Ruth was trapped until
Boaz bought her in Ruth 4.7, and as James Michener recounts in
modern-day Israel in The Source)? It may very well be that Jesus was
not so much calling her to face her sin, as letting her know that he
understood her victimization. Look at the Lord's words as recorded in
Scripture (as opposed to the ones we hear in commentaries and
sermons) - is there even one hint that he sees her situation as
sinful or attributes any blame to her? Is it not rather, in the light
of verses 23-24, more clearly a condemnation of the legalism by which
she has become a pariah? 
</P>
<P>I suggested most of these ideas in Bible study today - you should
have seen people light up as the concept of this encounter as a &quot;love
over law&quot; teaching resonated with their own experience. They
started talking about the importance of ignoring peoples sin long
enough to get to know the person; of showing solidarity without
showing blame. They started talking about the fear of blame and
judgement that keep divorcees and single mothers away from church.
Pastor left the room early and took his wife with him. On the up
side, several people came up to me and thanked me for my &quot;unusual
insights&quot;. Maybe the flip side of why God brought me to this
church is to be a counter-voice for social justice. 
</P>
<P>But think how different the church would be if the normal
understanding of this passage were &quot;Christ's example is to stand
beside social outcasts, **against** the judgementalism of the
institutional church&quot;! 
</P>
<P>-------------------------------- Now, all the above seems to have
little to do with the canon of the scripture. But Pastor also, rather
contemptuously it seemed to me, discounted the woman's scripture
knowledge as &quot;Samaritan Scripture&quot;. I had pointed out that
the canon of the scripture was still unsettled at the time and that
this was why my bible has 81 books but dh's has 66 -- Pastor flinched
again. DH joked that obviously the canon *still* isn't settled. Do
you know, Lulu, when (if ever) the Diaspora Jews finally abandoned
the Alexandrian canon? And were these &quot;Samaritan Scriptures&quot;
something else again? Both Pastor, and the footnotes in another
member's study bible alluded to them as something different than the
&quot;Jewish Scriptures&quot;. 
</P>
<P>I had it in my head that the Jewish &quot;canon&quot; was settled
in the middle of the eighth century; but reconsidering, I realize I
had that second hand from my sister's RC catechist who had a vested
interest in proving the RC canon was more authoritative than the
Protestant canon. On the other hand, I had the impression that the
Jews always made a clear distinction between the Torah (with its
accompanying expansion in Mishnah and Talmud), and other relatively
unimportant Scriptures. But these impressions are unscholarly
constructs derived from The Source and Chiam Potek's The Chosen, not
to mention various comments by a couple local rabbis at Canadian
Council of Christians and Jews meetings. Do our Jewish brothers and
sisters really have a &quot;canon&quot; in the way that most
Christians understand the term? 
</P>
<P>Which leaves me with only a handful more burning questions: Does
anyone know why the Vulgate's 3rd Esdras and 4th Esdras (which
Anglicans still accept as deutero-canonical) got dropped from the
Roman Catholic canon? And where did the Prayer of Manasseh come from
-- was it in the Vulgate? And what about third and fourth Maccabees
-- I've heard of them but only in passing as being &quot;non-biblical&quot;.
