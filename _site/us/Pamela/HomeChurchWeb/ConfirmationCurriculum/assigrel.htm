we will ask why we should study religion. We will also explore the ways in which

<b>Topic:</b> What is Religion; What is Scripture?<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> <i>In this class period we will look at some of the
issues in the study of religion. What is it? Do all religions speak of God? Can
we say Scripture is the "Word of God?" What is involved in such
statements? How do different academic disciplines regard religion?&nbsp;</i><br>

addresses.&nbsp;</i><br>

Biblical summaries of sacred history.&nbsp; What is the perspective of these

circumcision (the birth into the religious community for Jewish males) on the
