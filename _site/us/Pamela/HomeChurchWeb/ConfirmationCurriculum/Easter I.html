<h1>Tuesday 20 April 2004: A Time to Pray</h1>
<ul>
  <li>What is "Prayer"? <br>
Conversation with God. Importance of listening as well as talking.
Scope of conversation: more than just "gimme". Ways that God answers
prayer: not just "yes", "no", and "wait"; but also "you're welcome", "I
love you my dear", "fear not" and "there, there".</li>
  <li>When to pray? Fitting prayer into an already busy life. Creating
routines (experts say 21 to 28 days of repetition to establish a
routine).</li>
  <li>Monastics in the middle ages used the Daily Office, praying every
three hours throughout the day: Prime, Terce, Sexte, Nones, Vespers,
Compline, Lauds, Matins</li>
  <li>Cranmer combined the Monastic Offices into Morning Prayer and
Evening Prayer (Matins and Vespers) with the option of Prayers at
Mid-Day and Compline. Find in BCP and read rubrics.These are intended to be daily disciplines required of clergy (and optional for laity) not main Sumday worship.  <br>
  </li>
  <li>Prayers in Families -- Find in BCP. Typically table grace, bedtime prayers, and/or Morning Prayer.</li>
  <li>Some Protestants promote the idea of "quiet time"; 20 minutes to
an hour in the early morning spent reading and meditating on Scripture.</li>
  <li>Patterns for Prayer: "ACTS"<br>
  </li>
</ul>
