<h1>Tuesday 16 March 2004: What are Sacraments?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>"An Outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace,
given to us by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive this
grace, and a pledge to assure us thereof." (BCP 550)<br>
  </li>
  <li>"There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the
Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. Those five
commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance,
Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for
Sacraments of the Gospel ... for that they have not any visible sign or
ceremony ordained by God" (BCP 708)<br>
