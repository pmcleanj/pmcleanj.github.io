He is very interested in mommy's Bible but he loses interest very quickly if I read from it to him.Any suggestions on a book or books that I could purchase for him?</FONT></P> <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">My favourite for early readers is the Contemporary English Version...</FONT></P> <P>I never allowed bible story-books in the nursery, having a strong aversion to them from what I had observed in doctor's waiting-rooms and Sunday-School libraries: shallow, inaccurate paraphrases of Scripture with heavy-handed morals, often at odds with the deeper lessons of scripture. </P> <P>I have a collection of beautifully illustrated Bible *excerpts* using mostly direct authoritative translations; one does use a paraphrase but a very careful one: Tomei de Paolo, Sandal Stoddard, Tony Chen, and so on. The American Bible published several illustrated extracts from the CEV that were our mainstay for the preschool years. When Anne learned to read I got her this one: </P> <P><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=1016822253/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4892195-0380161">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=1016822253/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4892195-0380161</A> </P> <P>(There, that should screw up the page formatting for this post! &lt;g&gt;) </P> <P>The illustrations are bright and realistic without being highly detailed or formal, and show average semitic people instead of uniformly tall handsome nordic people. </P> <P>The text is extremely readable, and is a direct translation from original texts into the familiar language of a non-expert English-speaker. It's also my preferred text in most cases for reading Scripture aloud, since it permits the meaning to be followed easily by the majority of the audience. For rigourous study, more subtle and scholarly translations are preferable, but most serious students use more than one translation anyway. When your daughter is ten or twelve, you can get her another to supplement the CEV. </P> <P>I'm a big fan of the Contemporary English Version...</P> <P>The Contemporary English Version is a direct translation from the original text into a simple vocabulary suitable for unsophisticated readers. The American Bible Society has published some beautifully illustrated extracts from it that appeal well to children, as well as a complete bible (either protestant or Roman Catholic). </P> <P>Once dd8 was reading I got her the whole CEV illustrated bible, which is available in both protestant and Roman Catholic versions. </P> <P><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=985575529/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585160768/qid=985575529/sr=1-1/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564</A> or </P> <P><A HREF="http://www.chapters.ca/books/details/default.asp?mscssid=GMQQVU4AE2JH8P01EPENTWT7ES6G79QF&amp;WSID=22036DE320A6CB37420093125976191DCF382425&amp;ISBN=0785212280">http://www.chapters.ca/books/details/default.asp?mscssid=GMQQVU4AE2JH8P01EPENTWT7ES6G79QF&amp;WSID=22036DE320A6CB37420093125976191DCF382425&amp;ISBN=0785212280</A> </P> <P>For yonger children, the ABS has added a set of colouring books using the CEV text and a book with Gospel extracts.

However Sandol Stoddard's and Tony Chen's lovely book A Child's First Bible Storybook is faithful to the biblical text while presenting stories in a short, stunningly illustrated format. I used the earlier edition of this with my dd's when they were babies. <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0884862151/qid=985575767/sr=1-6/ref=sc_b_7/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0884862151/qid=985575767/sr=1-6/ref=sc_b_7/102-0014910-2126564</A> </P> <P>The Contemporary English Version is a direct translation from the original text into a simple vocabulary suitable for unsophisticated readers.

The concept of translating directly for children is interesting, but the result could be very good or very bad, or anywhere inbetween. The poor illustrations aren't a good sign. </P> <P>I am not a fan of &quot;kiddie&quot; prayers and songs. For devotions we simply use the Traditional ancient prayers of the church, the same that are used for adults. We started with the simplest prayers, combining them with extempore prayer. Children are excellent rote learners as you know if you have ever mis-read a word in their favourite story-book; so it doesn't take them long to add a new prayer or hymn to their repertoire. Since the Traditional prayers are rich in scriptural references, this technique writes the words of Scripture in their hearts. We taught them one at a time, starting with Nunc Dimittus (&quot;Lord lettest now thy servant depart in peace&quot;), since that is in &quot;A book about Jesus&quot; and the children had already learned it just from hearing the story over and over. The Lord's Prayer was one of the next, and Kontakion -- I can't remember which they learned first. </P> <P>But that being said, someone gave Anne a copy of Classic Children's Prayers <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0849911605/qid%3D985580601/102-0014910-2126564</A> (which I tried to ignore) and both children have memorized all the prayers in it and use them freely, so you might find such a thing a good resource. It's a board book, so the children can play with it and take ownership of it, without wearing it out. While I was looking for the reference at Amazon I also found this beautiful book containing some of the same prayers, and more: <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/185967447X/qid=985577876/sr=1-101/ref=sc_b_2/102-0014910-2126564</A> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> <P>For yourself, I think what you're looking for is more a Bible Companion than a concordance. </P> <P>A concordance is for looking up words in the bible, and how they were translated. If, for example, you remember a fragment of a quote, you can look up one of the words from the quote in your concordance and it will give you all the passages where that word occurs. The best-known English concordance is Strong's, which is a concordance of the King James Version. It also contains notes about how the individual Hebrew and Greek words were translated by the KJV translators. You can get this function online and save your money: one of my favourite such sites is the Blue Letter Bible: <A HREF="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</A> </P> <P>Another tool you might be thinking of, is a commentary. A commentary is a set of notes on the passages of Scripture. It is arranged book by book, chapter by chapter, verse by verse; so that as you read along in the Bible you can also see what various scholars have to say about the passage you are reading. Here's a previous discussion of commentaries: </P> <P><A HREF="http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html">http://boards2.parentsplace.com/messages/get/pplibchristiann11/56/2.html</A> </P> <P>Note that that discussion was in the context of quite scholarly commentaries. It is actually easier to find simpler and more readable commentaries than it is to find the hard ones. </P> <P>A bible companion, or a bible history or bible atlas helps you find the cultural, historical, and geographic context around the events that you are reading about. It may not deal with the passage itself, but will tell you about the countries, climates, and culture in which the passage was written. Here's one that several people have recommended (I don't have one myself): </P> <P><A HREF="http://makeashorterlink.com/?W2D735443">http://makeashorterlink.com/?W2D735443</A> </P> <P><BR><BR> </P> </BODY> </HTML><div class="post-links"> <a class="link-to-post" href="/explaining-9-11-in-Sunday-School/"> <span class="link-to-post__next">&#10535; &nbsp;Next post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Explaining 9 11 In Sunday School</span> </a> <a class="link-to-post" href="/us/pamela/childcare/"> <span class="link-to-post__prev">&#10535; &nbsp;Previous post</span> <span class="link-to-post__title">Childcare</span> </a></div></div></article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
