If you work two 60-hour weeks in a row, your productivity for the next two weeks will be crap. Lots of baby-boomer professionals believe they are “special” and that norm doesn’t apply to them; so they try to set a standard of working over-long days – and they close their eyes to the fact that they pretty soon HAVE to work eighty-hour weeks just to produce the thirty-hours worth of value they would produce if they took care of themselves (all the while holding themselves up as exemplars of a “sound work ethic”).</article><article class="index-page"><h3><a href="/resistance/old-school-conservative/">Old School Conservative</a></h3>People told me “If you aren’t liberal when you’re young you’re heartless.

One of the things Plan is doing here is a small animal project. There is a government &quot;One Cow - One Family&quot; plan but for families without sufficient land, a cow would be more of a hardship than a benefit. Plan provides support to these people by providing Pigs or Goats. In some cases, these are provided direct to families. In this case, the community decided that a collective approach would be better. They have a cement-floored barn housing 11 pigs, 10 sows and 1 boar. All of the sows are currently pregnant, and they expect to sell the piglets.</P> <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR> </P> <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> </P> </BODY> </HTML></ul><!-- create categories array--> <!--Add each unique 'my_collection' category to the array--> <!--Output the categories--><h5><div class="cat_list" > <a class="cats" href="">Rwanda</a></div></h5></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
