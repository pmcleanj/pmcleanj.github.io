<b><font color="#ffffff">The Lammastide Frontal</font></b></h4>
  
<h4> <b><i><font color="#ffffff">St Stephens Anglican Church, Calgary Alberta</font></i></b></h4>
 <font color="#ffffff">The Lammastide frontal was designed by Pamela Mclean 
and executed by Pamela Mclean and Erin Heibert. It depicts a lush wreath of
fruits and summer leaves, representing the "first fruits of the harvest" that
characterise the latter half of Pentecost. Green, the liturgical colour for
the Pentecost season, forms the base colour, the colour of the text and the
dominant colour in the wreath. The text carries on the theme of the fruits
by picking out the theme of the "fruits of the Spirit"</font> <br>

<h4> <b><i><font color="#ffffff">Emmanuel Lutheran Church, Calgary Alberta</font></i></b></h4>
 <font color="#ffffff">The Advent Banner represents the Holy Spirit moving 
over the face of waters, while herald trumpets proclaim the Good News -- the
good news of the first perfect creation, the good news of God's covenant, 
the good news of promised and awaited salvation: recapitulating the whole 
story of God's actions prior to the great gift of Our Saviour. The banner 
was designed by Pamela Mclean and executed by members of Emmanuel Lutheran 
Church.</font>

<b><font color="#ffffff">The Baptism Banner</font></b></h4>
  
<h4> <b><i><font color="#ffffff">Emmanuel Lutheran Church, Calgary Alberta</font></i></b></h4>
 <font color="#ffffff">Continuing the theme of the Advent Banner, the Baptism 
Banner represents the Holy Spirit moving over the waters of Baptism -- and
over the elements of the Eucharist. These are the two Great Sacraments --
the sacraments essential to belonging in Christ's Body the Church. The eucharistic
promise -- that we are all one body for we all share in the one bread --
is a promise proclaimed to all the Baptised, from the tiny baby in the heirloom
christening gown to the adult catechumen awaiting a midnight Easter immersion.
The banner was designed by Pamela Mclean for Emmanuel Lutheran Church and
is planned for completion in early 2001.</font>

 <font color="#ffffff">The Tree of Life Banner shows the River of Life flowing 
from a fountain immediately in front of the Lamb of God who stands on the 
horizon. Silk-ribbon flowers bloom on either side of the wandering stream, 
between the towering multi-fruited tree. On the ledge of the fountain sits 
the Woman at the Well, her water-jar set down while she rests in the presence 
of her Lord.</font> <br>
