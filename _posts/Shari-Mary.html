<h4><font size="+1">Once there was a little princess named Shari-Mary. Shari-Mary 
loved bright colours. She was a friend to all the brightly coloured things 
in her kingdom, and she wore their colours in her clothes. Her shoes were 
as red as the roses, her stockings were as orange as the rocks on the road, 
her skirt was a yellow as the sunshine, her sash was as green as the grass, 
her blouse was as blue as the sky, and her crown was of purple amethysts like
the mountains at the edge of her kingdom.</font></h4>
  
<h4><br>

</h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Every morning when she woke up, Shari-Mary said good-morning 
to the bright yellow sunbeam that shone into her room. But one morning, the
sunbeam wasn't bright and yellow. It was pale and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Sunbeam!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright
yellow colour?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the sunbeam. "Well,
why don't you chase him and get it back?" said Princess Shari-Mary.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"I can't chase him," said the sunbeam. "I'm just a little
sunbeam. I don't have feet to run after him or hands to catch him."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was 
bigger than a sunbeam, and she did have hands and feet. So she said bravely, 
"Don't worry little sunbeam. I'll chase the Black Bogle and get your colour
back. And in the mean time," she said, sighing a little, "you can share my
colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the little sunbeam soaked up all the bright yellow 
from Princess Shari-Mary's skirt, until her skirt was dull and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went to the window and looked out, 
to see if she could tell where the Black Bogle had gone. The sky overhead 
was pale and gray. Princess Shari-Mary gasped in amazement.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Sky!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright
blue colour?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the sky.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Well, why don't you chase him and get it back? You're
not too little. You cover the whole world" said Princess Shari-Mary.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"I cover the whole world," said the sky, "but I'm made
of nothing. I can't chase him."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she wasn't 
made of nothing. So she said bravely, "Don't worry, sky. I'll chase the Black
Bogle and get your colour back. And in the mean time," she said, sighing
a little, "you can share my colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the sky soaked up all the bright blue from Princess 
Shari-Mary's blouse, until her blouse was dull and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went from the palace. The palace garden
was covered with soft green grass. But today, the grass wasn't bright and
green. It was pale and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Grass!" said Shari-Mary. "What happened to your bright
green colour?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"The Black Bogle stole it," said the blades of grass.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Oh, you poor little things," said Princess Shari-Mary.
"And you can't chase him, can you, because you're rooted to the soil.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"That's right," said the blades of grass sadly.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was 
bigger than the blades of grass. So she said, "Don't worry, little blades
of grass. I'll chase the Black Bogle and get your colour back from the Black
Bogle. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the little blades of grass soaked up all the bright 
green from Princess Shari-Mary's sash, until her sash was dull and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary went past the rose-hedge that bordered 
the palace garden. The roses weren't their usual bright red. They were pale
and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Roses!" said Shari-Mary. "Did that Black Bogle steal
your bright red colour, too?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the roses sadly.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Now, Shari-Mary was just a little princess, but she was 
bigger and stronger than a rose. So she said bravely, "Don't worry little
roses. I'm going to catch that Black Bogle and get back the yellow for the
sunbeam and the blue for the sky and the green for the grass, and I'll get
back your colour too. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share my
colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the little roses soaked up all the bright red from 
Princess Shari-Mary's shoes, until her shoes were dull and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary carried on to the road that led away 
from the palace. The stones of the road, which were usually orange, were dull
gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Stones!" said Shari-Mary. "Did the Black Bogle come
this way and steal your colour?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the stones. "He ran away toward the mountains."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Don't worry," said Princess Shari-Mary. "I'm going to
catch that Black Bogle and get back the yellow for the sunbeam and the blue
for the sky and the green for the grass and the red for the roses, and I'll
get back your colour too. And in the mean time," she sighed, "you can share
my colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the little stones of the road soaked up all the bright 
orange from Princess Shari-Mary's stockings, until her stockings were dull 
and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Now Shari-Mary was dressed all in gray with only her crown
bright purple.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary carried on toward the purple mountains 
at the edge of her kingdom. But today, the mountains weren't purple. They 
were just plain gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Mountains!" said Shari-Mary. "Did the Black Bogle come
this way?"</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Yes," said the mountains. "He stole our purple colour.
Now he's hiding in his cave at the top of the mountains."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">"Well, I'm going straight to that cave to get back all
the colours he has stolen," said Princess Shari-Mary. "And in the mean time,"
she sighed, "you can share my colour."</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">So the mountains soaked up all the bright purple from 
Princess Shari-Mary's crown, until it was dull and gray.</font></h4>
  
<h4><br>

</h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Shari-Mary climbed up into the mountains. Her clothes 
were all dull and gray, so no-one noticed her climbing up the slopes, not 
even the Black Bogle. He was fast asleep in the back of his cave.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary tip-toed into the Black Bogle's Caves. 
Sitting in the middle of the Black Bogle's dining table was a beautiful magic
crystal, full of all the colours he had stolen. Princess Shari-Mary picked
up the crystal and started back out of the cave.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Just then, the Black Bogle woke up. "WHO IS THAT IN MY
CAVE!" he bellowed.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">Princess Shari-Mary was so frightened that she dropped 
the magic crystal. It shattered into a million sparkling bits, and the colours
all spilled out. They poured down the mountain-side in a beautiful rainbow,
ending right in the middle of the palace garden. Shari-Mary jumped onto the
rainbow and slid down it to get away from the Black Bogle. The colours flowed
out of the rainbow into all the things whose colours had been stolen, and
rubbed off the rainbow onto Shari-Mary's clothes. So once again, Princess
Shari-Mary's kingdom was full of brightly coloured things, and Shari-Mary
wore their colours on her clothes.</font></h4>
  
<h4><font size="+1">And as for the Black Bogle, he roared "HARRUMPH!" and
stomped back into his cave. </font></h4>
