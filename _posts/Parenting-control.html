        <ul>
          <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">"Control your child!" Hissed
with  ill-controlled anger and heavy with vague threat, the words are calculated 
 to fill a parent's heart with panic. Fight or flight are the instinctive 
 reactions, but a parent is wise to do neither. The wrong understanding  betrayed
by those words is best allowed to wither away in silence.</font>&nbsp;</font>
&nbsp;    
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The ideal of controlling
devolves  from an era when children were seen as the property of their parents,
to  be constrained to their parents will and used for their parents' profit. 
 As Christians, our role is not the control, but the education of children:</font>
&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  </p>
          <ul>
  <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control wins social approval
for the  parent, but education gives resources to the child.</font></font></li>
    <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control gratifies with instant
results,  but education is gradual and demanding of patience.</font></font></li>
    <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control entrenches parental
dominance  because it must be constantly maintained; but education gives
children  self-control so that they can mature beyond the need for our teaching.</font></font></li>
    <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Control aims to limit our
childrens'  behaviour; Education aims to broaden their understanding.</font></font></li>
  
          </ul>
  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">In short, control benefits adults; 
 education benefits children.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;    
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Does this mean that children
will  be rowdy and uncontrolled? Of course not! As children grow in independence 
 and physical ability, their understanding also grows. Parents can capture 
 every opportunity to teach the <b><i>underlying principals </i></b>of Christian 
 deportment, at a level appropriate to a child's understanding. For example, 
 even very young children can understand:</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  </p>
          <ul>
  <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">You must love God; you may
not annoy  other people; you must take care of yourself <b><i>(the Great
Commandment)</i></b></font></font></li>
    <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">If you don't like it when
someone does  it to you, probably they don't like it when you do it to them
              <b><i>(the  golden rule)</i></b></font></font></li>
    <li>  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Stronger people take care
of weaker  people, big people take care of little people <b><i>(the rule
of Chivalry)</i></b></font></font></li>
  
          </ul>
  <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Gradually parents teach their children 
 to discern behaviours that reflect underlying principals. A thoughtful  heart
driving thoughtful behaviour is more reliable than stern control  overriding
a rebellious heart! From time to time children push the limits  of acceptable
behaviour, signalling that it is time for the parents to  refine further
on the child's understanding. Sometimes the child's response  to such limitsetting
is loud, sometimes gracious; but the parent's role  in limit-setting need
not be obtrusive. If others don't notice a parent  setting limits, it may
be their awareness, not the parent's discipline,  that's falling short. All
that matters is that the child notices!</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;    
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">There is one other overriding
reason  that we cannot treat our children as possessions under our control.
With  infant baptism, our children become children of God: the precise status 
 that we enjoy ourselves! God has no grandchildren. In baptism our children 
 become our <i>brothers and sisters</i> in Christ. It would be grossly inappropriate 
 to domineer or usurp authority over them. Rather, as Ananias taught Paul, 
 as Prisca and Acquilla instructed Appollos, as adults encourage one-another 
 to grow to Christian maturity, such are our duties to these little brethren.</font>
&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  <br>
          <font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  <br>
          <font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Why though, must we inflict
our  children on the rest of the community during the slow, challenging period 
 of their education? Precisely because it <b><i>is</i></b> a community.  None
of us are yet perfected before God. But even imperfect, we are accepted  by
the One Who matters most. The nature of community is to accept: to nurture, 
 to encourage, and to upbuild one another.</font></font></p>
