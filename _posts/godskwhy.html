 <b><i><font color="#000099"><font size="+1">On Easter Sunday 1997 I was
asked, for the second week in a row, to remove my children from worship.
Although not as silent as little adults, the children were not behaving badly.
The request came from a parishioner who had, at the baptisms of those same 
children many months before, promised to do all in her power to support them
in their life in Christ. How little we mean the promises we make to our God!</font></font></i></b>
 <br>
<font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The following week, I began a search 
for an Anglican church community in Calgary, Alberta; where more than lip 
service was given to the value of children's ministry. Discouraged by the 
results, I expanded the search to include Lutheran, then Roman Catholic and
other congregations. Subsequently, I was able to address my church's Corporation
(that is, Priest and Wardens), on the subject of our ministry with children.
<a href="#theIssue">My notes</a> for that event are further down this page.</font></font>
 
<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1"><a href="godskids.html">"Are children 
welcome at Worship"</a> presents the results of my search. Churches are listed
from most child-friendly Worship to least child-friendly Worship; I didn't
consider any other characteristics. I couldn't visit every church I contacted,
so many of the results had to be inferred from the answers and attitudes
of the ministers, receptionists and volunteers who answered the phone. In
other cases, I talked to church members or visited the church for worship.</font></font>
 </p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">If you know more about any of the 
churches on this list or have a different impression of them, or if you have
an assessment of another church in Calgary that you would like added to this
list, I'll be happy to receive your e-mail at <i><a href="mailto:pamela@logrus.ca">
pamela@logrus.com</a></i>. I'll also gratefully accept advice.</font></font>

Toddlers in Church</a>, of course, present a special challenge. I liked <a href="http://www.new-ostrog.org/question3.html">
what Archbishop Lazar had to say</a>&nbsp; about their squirming. With older 
children, by far the most common practice is partial exclusion. This can be
seen as "welcome" only in contrast to total exclusion, but many churches that
practice partial exclusion, are honestly striving to welcome children.
(It's trivial, but I do wonder why some churches advise letting children stand on the
pew and others like<a href="http://www.us.net/edov/8/stalbans/tips.htm"> </a></font></font><a href="http://www.us.net/edov/8/stalbans/tips.htm"><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">St. Alban's

"Children's church" is another choice among churches that are not prepared

sincerity of its planners -- it should never be a euphemism for childcare.
Similarly&nbsp; religious instruction like <a href="http://www.catechesisgoodshepherd.org/">
"The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd"</a>-- scheduled outside of worship
time -- may have value if it is based on respect for the children and sound 
pedagogy.&nbsp;</font></font></blockquote>

By Worship, I mean the principal weekly worship of the Christian community, 
which by Tradition is the Service of Holy Communion and takes place on Sunday.
The Service of Holy Communion comprises all five elements of Gathering the
community, Ministry of the Word, Prayer, Celebration of the Eucharist, and
the Dismissal; all of which are essential elements of the service. This worship
is the defining act of the community, such that the congregation is often
referred to as the "Eucharistic Community". It is the right and duty of every
baptized person to take his or her part in the Divine Service: this is the
clear guidance of scripture, of the primitive church, and of the Rubrics
of the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services.&nbsp;</font></font>

Welcome does not include grudging or conditional tolerance, "separate but
equal" services where the children participate and the adults do not, or
special-guest appearances on "Intergenerational Sundays". These activities
have great value if children are not regularly welcome at Worship; but their
mere existence implies that the church dose not meet the standard of having
children visibly present, involved and accomodated at the whole of the principal
weekly worship.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

Our goal must be to do God's Will, as discerned through prayer and study
of Holy Scripture. Any other goal, any other standard, severs us from the
Vine. Did you hear the Gospel last Sunday? Did you write the words upon your
Spirit that you might speak them with your mouth and dwell on them in your
heart? "Whoever does not remain in me is thrown out like a branch and dries
up. <i>John 15v6</i>" What I am bringing before Corporation and Vestry is
an urgent spiritual concern arising from our joint baptismal calling and
supported unequivocably by Scripture. If you accept God's Will as our goal
and Scripture as our standard, you will hear its urgency. If you do not,
you will stand with the priests of Ancient Israel, whom God calls to account
for their scattered flock. <i>Jer 23v1</i></font></font> </p>

This is an issue of Salvation. Not of the children I named, who are safe
in God's care. But what of 1-year-old M- and 3-year-old G-, whom I met in
a playground? Their mother told me "I wish I could take them to church, but
someone would probably march down the aisle and throw us out." Or A- and
R-, whose mother said "I tried going to church, but they expected me to stay
in the lobby the whole time, and I thought, 'what's the point?'" We cannot
excuse ourselves by saying, "well, we have a Sunday School and a nursury
for the children." These mothers want to take their children to church, not
to a nursury. As more than one mother has said, "I work five days a week;
when I'm not working I want him with me." And toddlers and babies want to
be with their parents, too: nursuries do not work for under-two's. "Jesus
saw the crowds, and his heart was filled with pity for them, because they
were harassed and distressed, like sheep without a shepherd. So he said to
his disciples, 'The harvest is large, but there are few workers to gather
it in. Pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather
in the harvest.' <i>Matthew 9v36-38</i>" To see "harassed and distressed",
stand outside a daycare at 5:00 pm.</font></font> </p>

This is an issue of Salvation for D- and her three children. Perhaps we don't
have to change our ways for the sake of G-'s and A-'s mothers; we can tell
ourselves, they aren't Anglicans and if they really wanted to go to church
they'd find one somewhere. But D- was one of our "A-list" members. When she
stopped attending after her eldest was born I thought judgementally, "why
is it too hard to get the children to church when you manage to get them
to trivialities like swimming lessons and playschool?" What I learned during
Anne's toddler years is that it's not the getting here that's too hard, it's
being here in the face of expressed disapproval. Many mothers just give up
on church. D- told me she would be back when her children were older. They
are, but she's not.</font></font> </p>

This is an issue of Salvation for every adult in the congregation. Jesus
said "If anyone causes one of these little ones to fall away, it were better
for him if a millstone were tied around his neck and he were thrown into
the sea. <i>Matthew 18v6</i>" Children learn what they live. If they live
the experience of being set apart from the Body Sunday after Sunday, they
will learn to set themselves apart. Look around you! We, by our Sunday-School
practices, have caused the greater part of two generations to fall away from
their Lord. It hurts for a devout believer to look at her grown children
and know that the sum of their commitment is the occasional Christmas service.
She can shield herself by saying, "oh, well, it's not important; at least
they're good people." But it is important. To say otherwise denies our baptismal
covenant. God is giving us another chance in these other children. Let's
stop repeating our obvious mistakes.</font></font> </p>

Being Anglican is a distinct way of being Christian. It is defined by our
Book of Common Prayer, which is the witness to our Tradition. If we need
more guidance than Scripture, let us look first to that witness. The clear
teaching of our Prayer Book is that the Church is the whole company of Christ's
Catholic people militant here on earth. That's the whole company: all ages,
all colours, all abilities, all social classes, and people who sing out of
tune.&nbsp;</font></font>

The Prayer Book provides two additional concrete instructions, on how to
accomodate children. On page 530 it instructs Parents and Sponsors of a baptised
child to "teach him to pray, and bring him to take his part in public worship."
On page 544, it instructs the Pastor of every Parish to instruct and examine
the children of his Parish after the Second Lesson at Morning or Evening
Prayer.</font></font></p>

Vestry has considered publishing a standard for behaviour upon which welcome
would be contingent. Another word for 'contingent' is 'conditional, and a
conditional welcome has the same value as conditional love: none whatsoever.
Behaviour standards, however reasonable, will be perceived by Christ's "harrassed
and distressed" flock as a foundation for judgementalism, and we will be
barring our doors to those over-sensitive parents as effectively as if the
warden stood across the opening to turn them away. Parents are incredibly
sensitive to unintended criticism. One parent told me "Sometimes someone
will say, "you know we have a nursery don't you? You know what they mean,
and you just don't come back." Another told me, "I always think that if there
is a crying room, you're expected to be in it." Another was mortified and
left because a priest said "feel free to walk around if it will help (comfort
your crying baby)". Another said "they say children are welcome, but they
always add 'of course, if he get's really bad, you'll want to take him out.'
Then you know you're going to have to live up to their standard of what is
'really bad'". In my search, I came across two churches, both Lutheran, who
were particularly kind to paranoid parents. Foothill's Lutheran staff never 
mention their excellent crying room without adding "but we hope parents will
try to cope in the pew first." And the staff at Emmanuel Lutheran added,
"Of course, if he gets really upset,...it'll still be up to you."</font></font>
