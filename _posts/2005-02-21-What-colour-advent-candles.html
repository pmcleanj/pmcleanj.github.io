## Question: Regarding Advent Candles, how important is
it to have the "correct" colours for the advent candles? 

I can find the white and the pink, but am unable to find a deep
pink/red/purple one for Christmas. I know the Lutheran Church in our
area uses blue and white. I think the minister said it had something
to do with separating Advent and Lent so the colors didn't confuse
people? 

## Answer: Hmm, white and pink with a red Christmas candle is a new
combination for me...

I'm used to four purples and a white, with the radical Catholic
part of me leaning toward three purples, a pink, and a white. 

Some Swedish Lutherans -- the inventors of the Advent Wreath --
are surprised that the candles are any colour but white. And many
Lutherans use four blue candles. My Metis mother-in-law uses Red,
Yellow, Blue and Green because those are the colours of the Four
Corners of the Earth on a Medicine Wheel.  The advent wreath is just
a custom, not a doctrine or tradition, so do whatever works to create
more reverence and devotion in your home.

Blue paraments is a Lutheran thing -- and good liturgy, since
purple is for penance, and Advent is more preparatory than
penitential (although all preparation has a penitential aspect). It
does have some historical basis, along with other obscure colours
like rose-pink paraments for festivals of the Blessed Virgin and
black paraments for Ash Wednesday; although I don't know whether any
of those less-common colours have historical basis in the non-Roman
catholic churches.
