<P>New drinking game (slash candy-eating game for those who prefer
their amusement in candy form): watch the Alberta leaders debate and
count how many times Brian Jean says &quot;the Wildrose is the only
party that will not raise taxes&quot; instead of actually answering
the question.</P>
<P>He's one person in a four-person debate, so there's a limit to how
much of the time he can spend talking. But he's managed to shoe-horn
that phrase, or some minor variation on it into all but two of the
topics, usually by just ignoring the topic altogether.</P>
