<p><font size="+1">A wedding is a new beginning, and an appropriate time to
acquire new household effects: fine linens, beautiful china and crystal, well-crafted
necessities. A wise couple will consider first, what household goods they
already possess; next, what possessions would grace thier home of dreams;
and finally what they wish to acquire, replace or dispose of, to bring the
reality and dreams together. High standards and a long view will never be
in error. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">By all means, a bride should register. Much crass advice 
is given that registering helps guests choose appropriate gifts and prevents 
duplicate gifts. No gently-bred bride would dream of influencing her guests 
in this way; indeed, she expects no gifts at all. But registering greatly 
helps a bride plan the trousseau which, acquired over the years, will graciously 
complement her way of life. Good shops retain such records for many years 
-- and the very best shops will keep such a registry for a good customer of
whatever marital status. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">In planning tableware, consider how you will entertain. 
If you never serve a formal dinner, acquire only glassware, stoneware and 
stainless steel; if you never entertain casually, acquire only crystal, porcelaine
and silver. Unused "Wedding China" is a silly affectation. Determine the
minimum courses you will serve, and obtain first the pieces you will need
for that, ignoring the china-shop's definition of a "place setting" (a china-shop's
"place setting" contains five pieces, only two of which are correctly used
at a formal dinner). Consider also how many guests you will sit down at one
time: four, eight or twelve guests (in addition to the host and hostess)
are pleasant numbers. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">A young couple who are beginning to practice hospitality, 
will do well to try first simple three-course meals; first for one another, 
then for only four guests. Thus for soup, a meat course, and cake -- a gracious
example -- they should have available: six each soup-plates, dinner-plates, 
glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each dinner-knives, dinner-forks, 
salad forks, and dessert spoons; six red-wine glasses; a soup-toureen, a
platter, two vegetable dishes, and a cake plate; a soup ladle, carving knife
and fork, two serving spoons and a cake knife. Alternately for a meat course,
salad, and pudding they should have available: six each dinner-plates, salad
plates, glass dessert plates, and dessert dishes; six each soup-spoons, dinner-knives,
dinner-forks, dessert forks; six red-wine glasses; a platter, two vegetable
dishes, a salad bowl, and a pudding bowl; a carving knife and fork, two serving
spoons, salad servers and a pudding spoon.</font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">If one has acquired for each cover -- a "cover" being
that which the china-shops call a "place setting" -- a large spoon, a large
knife, and a large fork; the most versatile piece of cutlery to obtain next
is a smaller fork, which may serve as a fish-fork, salad-fork, dessert-fork,
or for the appetizer course. Dinner-plates, ten inches in diameter, are the
most necessary piece of china; followed by eight-inch plates which may serve
for salad, appetizer or dessert. Soup-plates are used only for soup and so
may seem dispenable; but may be omitted only at the cost of omitting to serve
soup. </font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">A silver-chest which contains for each cover a soup-spoon, 
fish-knife and fish-fork, dinner-knife and dinner-fork, lunch-knife and lunch-fork,
salad-fork, dessert-fork, dessert-spoon, tea-spoon, coffee-spoon and demitasse-spoon;
and appropriate serving-pieces; will meet the most ambitious requirements
of most couples. Similarly even the best-stocked china cupboard rarely contains
more than soup-plates, cover-plates, ten-inch plates, six-inch plates, glass
eight-inch plates, tea-cups and saucers, coffee-cups and saucers,demi-tasses
and saucers, and three sets of eight-inch plates; and serving dishes.</font></p>
