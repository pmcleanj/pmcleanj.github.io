          <font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">"<i>I pity you when they're 
 teenagers!"</i></font></b><font size="+1"> I got the impression it was not 
 so much pity, as vengeful glee that the speaker was entertaining, at the 
 thought of teenagers being "inflicted" upon me.We live in a strange world, 
 where the dawning maturity of our offspring is anticipated with dread,  and
beloved family members are expected to spend seven years as "the enemy".  
Why <b><i>should </i></b>they become our enemies?</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; 
   
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Actually, there are some
good reasons  for teenage conflict. The primary one is, that there is no
such life-stage  as "teenage". No-one is happy to be forced into a role that
doesn't exist.  In traditional cultures one makes the transition directly
from the well-defined  world of childhood, directly to the equally well-defined
world of adulthood.  When a Jewish boy on his thirteenth birthday says, "today
I am a man",  he means it. All at once, his parents lose the right to obedience,
and  become mere advisors who, having had their say, must let their son make 
 his own choices -- and let him live with the consequences. Our culture  "invented"
teenagerhood, because our adults are unwilling to let our children  have
their own responsibilities.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;    </p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">The argument is made that
at thirteen,  or even nineteen, a person is not ready to take on adult responsibilities: 
 you certainly wouldn't expect them to pay room and board. Wrong! At nineteen, 
 or even thirteen, a person who does not choose to accept your advice cannot 
 be forced to accept it. Sixty years ago he might have run away to the frontier 
 or the army, today he can run to the streets. <i>And you will lose him</i>
.  You had better make sure all the groundwork for your child's character 
 is complete by the time he is twelve, because that is the only chance you 
 will get! And, if the groundwork is complete, we can trust our young-adult 
 children to continue the building themselves.</font>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  
  </p>
          <p><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">We have only twelve years
to give  a child all the "upbringing" that he will get. If that inflicts
a terrible  sense of urgency upon the parents of infants and toddlers, so
much the  better. Let us pour our energies today, into giving our children
the best  spiritual training we can; and at the same time let us train up
our own  hearts in courage so that at the right moment, we can let them go.</font>
