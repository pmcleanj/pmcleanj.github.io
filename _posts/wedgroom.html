<p><font size="+1">The bridegroom is responsible for his own attendants: for
deciding how many there will be, selecting them, and seeing that he and they
appear at the designated time and place, if not correctly attired, at least
appropriately (and identically) attired . "Correctly attired" offers no scope
for innovation: it means grey cutaways and striped trousers before six o'clock
and black evening-dress with tails afterward. "Appropriately attired" offers
slightly more variety: grey "strollers" might replace the cutaways or a black
dinner-jackets replace the tail-coats. White or grey dinner-jackets -- though
still with black trousers -- might be risked by an adventuresome groom. Or,
at risk of appearing too casual, three-piece suits might be worn: black,
or grey if before six o'clock. Shirts are always white and unruffled, but
if no vest be worn the shirt-front may be pleated. True sartorial adventure,
however, is allowed in the choice of ties and cumberbunds. Unless wearing
tail-coats, in which case the gentlemen are restricted to black or white
ties and cumberbunds (a wing-tip collar being allowed if white is chosen),
these items may be of any colour, or even patterned. A wedding not being
Broadway, there need not be equal numbers of groomsmen and bridesmaids coordinated
by height and costume: the staging of the processional is to be adapted to
the dear friends who will take part, not friends chosen to suit the processional.
Yet by coincidence, nearly all grooms choose exactly the number of attendants
that their brides, if given any say, would have wished; and most brides on
their wedding-day are unsurprised by how the groomsmen dress -- even when
they appear in the most inappropriate puce trousers with ruffled pink shirts.
</font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">On festive occasions, a gentleman always sends flowers 
to a woman whom he admires. In general, a gentleman who sends flowers to several
women at once is a cad; but on this occasion when he makes the transition
from son to husband (and son-in-law) he wisely sends corsages to his mother
and his mother-in-law to be, and an impressive bouquet to his bride. The
bride sees her bouquet for the first time when it arrives as a gift from
her groom on the day of her wedding, but -- again purely by coincidence --
the groom's choice of flowers always coordinates perfectly with the the bride's
dress, and with the bouquets she herself has provided for her bridesmaids.
</font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">The groom buys a wedding ring and has it engraved. He also
purchases the marriage license, and pays the cleric who performs the wedding,
discreetly slipping him a envelope containing the fee -- so that the bride
need never know that the wedding was sullied by any commercial transaction.
</font></p>
  
<p><font size="+1">And once wed, the groom whisks his bride away on a splendid 
trip which he has planned and paid for, impressing her not only with this 
evidence of his ability to take charge of such details, but also with his 
cleverness in choosing just the destination she herself would have chosen.
