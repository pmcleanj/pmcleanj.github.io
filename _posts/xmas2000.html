<h2> A Christmas Pageant in five Vignettes, for Schools in Multicultural
Communities</h2>
</center>
  
<center> 
<h4> Characters:</h4>
</center>
  
<center>&nbsp;Bridget, a homeless child of about 6 <br>
Leah, her elder sister <br>
Mother (of&nbsp; Bridget and Leah) <br>
A social worker <br>
Santa Claus 
<p>Prehistoric tribesmen (Preschool class) <br>
Prehistoric matriarch (Preschool teacher) </p>
<p>Maccabean Jews (Kindergarten/Grade 1 class) </p>
<p>Ancient Celts (Grade 2/3 class) </p>
<p>mediaeval Noble family (Grade 4/5 class) </p>
<p>Inn from the Cold volunteers (Grade6/7 class)</p>
</center>
  
<p><font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Sets</b>: Prelude, interludes, 
and vignettes 1, and 3 will benefit from having a starry sky. This could be
done with a black-painted paper sheet with holes cut in it , with a light
behind it that could be turned off for the other vignettes. Several vignettes
rely on a fire. This should be made with small logs stacked "log-cabin" style.
Fire-retardent crepe paper flames should be attached on the inside in different
lenghths that can be tucked inside the logs and unfolded at need, so that
the fire can be made to "flare up": short red flames; medium orange flames;
very large yellow flames. A sheilded work-lamp placed in the middle of the
stack of logs makes the fire glow.</font></font> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Prelude and interludes:</b> Two 
garbage cans, representing an alley <i><b>Properties:</b> Matchbox, small 
flashlight,</i></font></font> <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 1</b>: A small fire centre
stage,&nbsp; under an open sky <i><b>Properties</b>: Spears for tribesmen</i></font></font>
 <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 2:</b> A lamp on a lampstand
centre stage. A cardboard cutout statue of Zeus that can be toppled over.
A small table covered with a table-cloth, on which is set a menorah with
candles, stage right. <i><b>Properties:</b> Broken oil flask. Intact flask.
Sign reading "Next Day". Sign reading "Seven Days Later"</i></font></font>
 <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 3:</b> Stonehenge. This
is just a <i>little</i> ambitious, but it is sufficient just to suggest Stonehenge
with a pair of standing stones and capstone, painted on a sheet or a length
of paper hanging from a banner-stand. The altar-stone can be made from a
low table draped in a sheet painted to look like stone. The fire, with flames
hidden inside and the light turned off, should be placed on the altar-stone.
All the other stones are imaginary. <i><b>Properties:</b> Holly and ivy garlands.
Magnifying glass.</i></font></font> <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 4:</b> A mediaeval kitchen,
with a large central open fireplace in which is a blazing fire. A stand for
a spit, and a rack for the wassail bowl, stand before the fire. <i><b>Properties:</b>
 Wassail bowl, spit laden with apples, basket of eggs, honey pot, spices, 
wine-jug, mixing bowl for eggs, 2 wooden spoons.</i></font></font> <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Vignette 5:</b> Iron bedstead and
long table with cloth <i><b>Properties:</b>&nbsp;</i> <i>wassail bowl,&nbsp; 
menorah. Christmas Tree. Casserole dishes. Bedding.</i></font></font> <br>
<font color="#000099"><font size="-1"><b>Lighting</b>: The lighting assumes 
two spots. It is desirable if a red filter can be placed over the centre-stage 
spot for vignette #1. The second spot is used to bring the focus back to Leah
and Bridget, and should be relatively dim since they are supposed to be hiding
in an unlit alley. In vignette #2, however, the second spot is also used
to draw the focus to the lighting of the menorah which shows the passage
of time, after which it will go back to focussing on Bridget and Leah. If
lights are not available, Bridget and Leah should point centre stage when
the action starts there and maybe say "Look" as though they are seeing a
magical vision, to redirect the audience's focus to centre stage. Bridget
and Leah should then sit as still as possible during the vignette. At the
end of the vignette, the vignette actors can simply leave the stage, and
Bridget and Leah begin moving and speaking again.</font></font> </p>

planet, so it points toward the Sun when the North points away from the Sun.

I have used the common names for the quarter and cross-quarter days where
the names are familiar but not obviously Christian (May Day, Midsummer, and
Hallowe'en); otherwise I have given the Celtic names. Here are the Celtic
names with the name of the Christian celebration that replaced it in brackets.
The eight days are: Yule (or Christmas) on December 25; Imbolc (or Candlemas)
on February 2; Ostara (or Ladyday) on March 25; Beltane (or May Day, or Saint
Walburg's day, or Walpurgisnacht) on May 1; Litha (or Midsummer) on June
25; Lammas (the feast of first fruits, keeping the same name of "Lammas"
in the Christian calendar) on August 1; Mabon (or Michaelmas) on September
25; Samhain (or All Saints Day, or Hallowe'en) on November 1. Note that the
traditional calendar dates are actually 3-4 days after the solstices or equinoxes, 
apparently an artifact of calendar reform.</font></font></i></li>

Archeologists are not firmly agreed on the function of the stone circles:
two common suggestions are that they had significance either as religious
structures, or as astronomical observatories; perhaps both. The notion that
the druids had optical glass, either for observing the stars or for focusing
sunbeams to light a fire, is highly improbable -- but it makes a good story.</font></font></i></li>
