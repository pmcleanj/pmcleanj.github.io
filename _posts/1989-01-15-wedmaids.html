<p><font size="+1">A maiden marrying from her mother's home should choose 
a maid of honour of a similar age, with whom she can share intimate confidences. 
An independent spinster who is planning her own wedding should choose as matron
of honour a senior woman who has previously planned a wedding or who has
entertained formally; who can affirm the bride's wiser decisions and advise
her of her less wise decisions. In either case, the honour attendant should
be a dear and trusted friend. In selecting gowns for herself and her attendants,
a bride should consider that they will for some time be standing with their
backs to the congregation. Thus, the gowns should incorporate significant
design interest on the back, as well as the front: A train, bows, flounces,
and appliques are such examples. The bride's mother, in fact anyone not in
the actual wedding party, must be considered wise enough to choose her own
apparel. In general, attendants provide their own apparel, according with
the bride's wishes. A thoughtful bride therefor chooses no dress for her
maids that proves unflattering, or impractical for later wear. Often the
honour attendant is dressed differently from the other maids, and indeed
all may be dressed differently, their costumes linked only by some consistency
in design or colour. All gentlemen in a wedding party properly dress alike.
