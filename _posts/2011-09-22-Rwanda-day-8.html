<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We started out visiting a &quot;Pigery&quot;.
 One of the things Plan is doing here is a small animal project. 
There is a government &quot;One Cow - One Family&quot; plan but for
families without sufficient land, a cow would be more of a hardship
than a benefit.  Plan provides support to these people by providing
Pigs or Goats.  In some cases, these are provided direct to families.
 In this case, the community decided that a collective approach would
be better.  They have a cement-floored barn housing 11 pigs, 10 sows
and 1 boar.  All of the sows are currently pregnant, and they expect
to sell the piglets.</P>
