People have on average about 120 hours per month of productivity in them. If you work two 
60-hour weeks in a row, your productivity for the next two weeks will be crap. Lots of 
baby-boomer professionals believe they are “special” and that norm doesn’t apply to them; 
so they try to set a standard of working over-long days – and they close their eyes to the 
fact that they pretty soon HAVE to work eighty-hour weeks just to produce the thirty-hours 
worth of value they would produce if they took care of themselves (all the while holding 
themselves up as exemplars of a “sound work ethic”).

DON’T let them pressure you into living the same stupid life lack-of-balance that they’ve 
deluded themselves into living.
