<P>The Harper Conservatives are trying to rush their 242-page
election law through Parliament with minimal debate and no expert
testimony, despite major flaws that would have lasting consequences
for our democracy.</P>
<P>I don't usually share things like this, but voter participation is
a bit of a bugbear of mine. I haven't read the entire act, but I did
confirm the increased voter ID requirements. While they're not
insane, they will make it harder for some people to vote, which means
they'll probably do more harm than good, since (as the petition
points out) evidence suggests that voter fraud by individuals is a
fantasy.</P>
<P>Voter turnout in the last federal election was barely over 61%.
It's hard enough getting people out to vote at all. We don't need to
be taking any steps to reduce voting further, especially over
something that isn't a real issue.</P>
