  <td colspan="3"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">As a parent, you 
 usually find no shortage of advice on how to handle your children. For  example,
when bringing your children to church, you hear that you can use  the back
or side aisles to walk your fussy baby, and that you should bring  crayons
and paper for older children to draw the themes of the lessons  and sermon.
Hmmn. Good ideas both, but walking won't calm a fussy nine-month  old, and
even a thirty-month-old is unlikely to produce focused artwork.  You can't
find much advice on dealing with toddlers in church, because  there simply
are no obvious strategies. Babies predictably lack all verbal  skills and
motor control, so we can predict that certain things will comfort  them;
pre-schoolers have essentially the same language a</font></b> <b><font size="+1">
nd  nervous maturity as adults though with less experience, so we can expect 
 certain behaviours from them. But toddlers by definition are somewhere  between
the complete lack of verbal and nervous developement that characterises  a
baby, and the relative maturity that characterises a child. And they're  traversing
the gap at breakneck speed.</font></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;    
        <p><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">When confronted with
toddlerhood  let's face it, most parents just give up and resort to the nursery
"until  he reaches a stage where he can behave in church". I can sympathise,
but  that's a lot like deciding not to talk to your child until he can use
full  sentences, or not to bother with giving him dishes until he figures
out  table manners. The biggest thing your toddler is learning over these
two  years is to relate: to relate the ME to the NOT-ME, to relate his body 
 to the space he occupies, to relate physical objects to his control of  them,
and to relate how living things respond to his own responses. Will  he learn
to relate to God? A lot depends on whether we let him respond  to God during
his toddler years.</font></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;    </p>

your  toddler to church. For my part, I'll provide the missing Good Advice:

  <td><font color="#000000"><b><font size="+1">There. I've dumped the problem 
 back in your lap. I'd rather have your toddler in my lap than your problems, 
 anyhow. But for free, here are some equally reliable suggestions:</font></b>
&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;  <br>
&nbsp;  
        <ul>
  
          <blockquote>  <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">
Let your child wander within  limits. </font></i><font size="+1">A person
who has just learned how to walk  has a highly developed spacial awareness.
Such a person would be as frustrated  by not being allowed to move around,
as you would be if you were told to  keep your eyes closed.</font></font></b></li>
  </blockquote>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Limit your child to
what you  are comfortable with. </font></i><font size="+1">You may be comfortable
with  your child is anywhere on the Nave </font>(or "sanctuary")<font size="+1">
  floor, but not if she goes into the Chancel or climbs on the pews. If your 
 anxiety level peaks don't worry about being overly controlling: rein her 
 in. Then remember, and enforce that limit from then on. As soon as she  breaches
the limit, fetch her back a distance, state the limit, and let  her go again.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Don't reward fusses.
              </font></i><font size="+1">If  you have to remove your child,
take him into the narthex or other area,  but give him LESS freedom than
he'd have in church. For example, hold him  still on your lap. If he's fussing
from tiredness or overstimulation that  should calm him better than letting
him run around, and if not it will  make being in church preferable to being
removed. Eventually - over four  to six months of this treatment - he may
start to quiet as soon as you  stand up with him.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Beware of growth spurts
              </font></i><font size="+1">which  cause ravenous hunger and
nervous stress. Have biscuits or cereal for your  toddler to snack on, and
something cuddly for her to curl up with if she's  tired.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DON'T try to DISTRACT
a fussy  toddler -- DO try to ENGAGE her. </font></i><font size="+1">A liturgical 
 church is full of vivid sensual experiences. Draw his attention to the  action
of the Eucharist - "Look, Father has the Holy Bread! Do you see  the Holy
Bread? Where's the Holy Bread?" - or to the stained glass, or  to familiar
symbols like the cross, or to other worshippers. After a baptism,  let him
touch the water, and draw a cross on his forehead like the one  on the baby's
forehead. DEFINATELY let him take the communion. Provide  toys if you can,
that also draw the focus back to the worship: bible-based  activity blankets
or stuffed bible-toys, or scriptural soft books. But  remember the first
rule of toddlerhood: there ARE no quiet toys. You just  have to modulate
the noise the best you can, and try not to worry.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DON'T stifle your child's
response  to God. </font></i><font size="+1">If he points and shouts "Cross!
Cross!"  at the Gospel procession, great! You can reinforce his enthusiasm
AND model  appropriate vocal control at the same time, by murmuring "Yes,
my dear,  that's the Cross! Good for you". But vocal modulation is generally
not  a developmentally appropriate emphasis at this age.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">DO bow your head and
steeple  your hands</font></i><font size="+1">, make the sign of the cross,
bow at  the name of Jesus, and teach your child to do these things too. Children 
 like games with rules, and these are the "rules" for worshipping. Later  
when they're teenagers they can rebel by not bowing their heads, and they 
 won't have to run away to feel appropriately rebellious.</font></font></b></li>
    <li>  <b><font color="#000000"><i><font size="+2">Give your child money
to put  in the offering plate</font></i><font size="+1"> as soon as she recognises 
 what money is and can be counted on not to swallow it. Make the offering 
 the purpose of your child's allowance: she gets two pennies SO that she  
can give one to God. As soon as she understands counting to 10, give her  
10 pennies, and insist that one is for God. As she gets older, give her  her
allowance in multiples of 10 right before church (or on Saturday night  if
you feel giving allowance constitutes breaking the Sabbath) so that  it's
always easy to tithe. Inure yourself to the sound of pennies falling  on
the floor: i<span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 51);">f enough supporters had le</span></font></font><font style="color: rgb(51, 0, 51);" size="+1">arned
